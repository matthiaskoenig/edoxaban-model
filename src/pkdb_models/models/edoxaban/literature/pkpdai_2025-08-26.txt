TI  - Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of edoxaban in end-stage renal disease 
      subjects undergoing haemodialysis.
PG  - 719-27
LID - 10.1160/TH14-06-0547 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral, direct, once-daily, factor Xa inhibitor developed for stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and for the treatment and 
      secondary prevention of recurrent thromboembolism in patients with acute 
      symptomatic venous thromboembolism. Among elderly patients who require 
      anticoagulation therapies, some may have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This 
      open-label, phase 1, randomised, two-way crossover study was conducted to 
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in 10 subjects on haemodialysis. 
      Eligible subjects with ESRD on chronic haemodialysis received a single, oral dose 
      of edoxaban 15 mg 2 hours (h) prior to (on-dialysis) or in between (off-dialysis) 
      haemodialysis sessions. Haemodialysis resulted in a minor decrease in mean total 
      exposure (AUC0-∞; 676.2 ng·h/ml) as compared with that observed in subjects 
      off-dialysis (691.7 ng·h/ml). Mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) 
      values were comparable between on-dialysis and off-dialysis treatments (53.3 vs 
      56.3 ng/ml, respectively). Mean apparent total body clearance (CL/F) values were 
      24.1 and 22.5 l/h during the on-dialysis and off-dialysis treatment periods, 
      respectively. Dialyser clearance was 5.7 l/h and haemodialysis clearance was 6.1 
      l/h. Haemodialysis clearance was only 6.1 l/h, suggesting that it only accounts 
      for one-fourth of the total clearance in these subjects. A single, oral dose of 
      15 mg of edoxaban was well tolerated by subjects with ESRD. In conclusion, based 
      on these single-dose PK data, a supplementary dose of edoxaban may not be 
      required following a haemodialysis session. Importantly, haemodialysis is not an 
      effective mechanism for removal of edoxaban from the blood.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and its main metabolite in a dedicated 
      renal impairment study.
PG  - 1268-79
LID - 10.1002/jcph.541 [doi]
AB  - A model characterizing the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban and its 
      major metabolite, M4, following a single oral dose of 15 mg administered to 
      subjects with varying kidney function was developed. Thirty-two subjects 
      contributed with edoxaban plasma, edoxaban urine, and M4 plasma concentrations. 
      Edoxaban urine concentrations allowed estimation of renal clearance, and high 
      contribution of renal to total clearance enabled estimation of absolute oral 
      bioavailability. A 2-compartment model with delayed absorption and elimination 
      parameterized as renal clearance linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLcr ) 
      and nonrenal clearance forming M4 described edoxaban PK. The PK of M4 was 
      described with a 1-compartment model. For a typical subject (70 kg; CLcr , 
      100 mL/min) bioavailability, clearance, and central and peripheral volume of 
      distribution for edoxaban was estimated to 72.3%, 21.0 L/h, 95.4 L, and 54.3 L, 
      respectively. For both edoxaban and M4, the model predicted systemic exposure to 
      increase 57.0%, 35.0%, and 11.6% in a subject having CLcr of 30, 50, and 
      80 mL/min, respectively, compared with a subject having a CLcr of 100 mL/min. 
      Concentration ratios (M4 over edoxaban) were predicted to vary with time after 
      dose, but with minor influence of kidney function and body weight. Results were 
      in agreement with previous analyses.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban, a Non-Vitamin K Antagonist 
      Oral Anticoagulant that Inhibits Clotting Factor Xa.
PG  - 641-55
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0342-7 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban, a once daily non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, is a direct, 
      selective, reversible inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa). In healthy subjects, single 
      oral doses of edoxaban result in peak plasma concentrations within 1.0-2.0 h of 
      administration, followed by a biphasic decline. Exposure is approximately dose 
      proportional for once daily doses of 15-150 mg. Edoxaban is predominantly 
      absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract, and oral bioavailability is 
      approximately 62 %. Food does not affect total exposure to edoxaban. The terminal 
      elimination half-life in healthy subjects ranges from 10 to 14 h, with minimal 
      accumulation upon repeat once daily dosing up to doses of 120 mg. The 
      steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 107 L, and total clearance 
      is approximately 22 L/h; renal clearance accounts for approximately 50 % of total 
      clearance, while metabolism and biliary secretion account for the remaining 50 %. 
      Intrinsic factors, such as age, sex and race, do not affect edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics after renal function is taken into account. Oral administration 
      of edoxaban results in rapid changes in anticoagulatory biomarkers, with peak 
      effects on anticoagulation markers (such as anti-FXa), the prothrombin time and 
      the activated partial thromboplastin time occurring within 1-2 h of dosing.

TI  - Edoxaban administration following enoxaparin: a pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, 
      and tolerability assessment in human subjects.
PG  - 166-75
LID - 10.1160/TH11-09-0676 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral direct factor (F)Xa inhibitor in advanced stages of clinical 
      development. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of enoxaparin 1 mg/kg followed 12 hours (h) 
      post-dose by edoxaban 60 mg, which is the regimen being used in the phase III 
      study of edoxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (Hokusai-VTE). This 
      was a phase I, open-label, randomised, four-period, four-treatment cross-over 
      study. Treatments were edoxaban alone (EDOX), enoxaparin alone (ENOX), edoxaban 
      plus enoxaparin (EDOX+ENOX), and enoxaparin followed by edoxaban 12 h later 
      (ENOX12-EDOX). Serial blood samples were collected for PD (thrombin generation, 
      anti-FXa) and pharmacokinetic (PK) variables (edoxaban and its principal 
      metabolite M4 by LC-MS/MS, and anti-FIIa as a surrogate of enoxaparin). The 
      highest effect on thrombin AUC (endogenous thrombin potential, or ETP), thrombin 
      (peak), thrombin generation lag time, and velocity index was observed for 
      EDOX+ENOX, followed by ENOX, ENOX12-EDOX, and EDOX. The greatest effect on 
      anti-FXa activity was observed for EDOX+ENOX, followed by ENOX12-EDOX. As 
      expected, neither edoxaban nor enoxaparin significantly altered the PK of the 
      other drug. There were no serious adverse events during the study. It is 
      concluded that a 60-mg dose of edoxaban can be safely administered 12 h following 
      enoxaparin 1 mg/kg.

AB  - This is a clinical safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) study of a single ascending dose (SAD) and a multiple 
      ascending dose (MAD) of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban in healthy 
      males. The placebo-controlled, single-blind, randomized, 2-part study consists of 
      a SAD arm with 85 subjects (10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 mg) and a MAD arm with 36 
      subjects (90 mg daily, 60 mg twice daily, 120 mg daily). Effects of food and 
      formulation (tablet vs solution) are assessed in a crossover substudy. In the 
      SAD, doses are well tolerated up to 150 mg. Exposure is proportional to dose. PK 
      profiles are consistent across dose with rapid absorption, biphasic elimination, 
      and terminal elimination half-life of 5.8 to 10.7 hours. In the MAD, mean 
      accumulation after daily dosing is 1.10 to 1.13 and consistent with elimination 
      half-life of 8.75 to 10.4 hours. Intrasubject variability ranges from 12% to 17% 
      for area under the curve. In general, plasma edoxaban concentrations are linearly 
      correlated with coagulation parameters. Edoxaban is safe and well tolerated with 
      no dose-dependent increases in adverse events. It is concluded that single and 
      multiple doses of edoxaban are safe and well tolerated up to 150 mg with 
      predictable PK and PD profiles.

AB  - This study determined the mass balance and pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in humans 
      after oral administration of [¹⁴C]edoxaban. After oral administration of 60 mg 
      (as active moiety) of [¹⁴C]edoxaban to six healthy male subjects, serial 
      blood/plasma and urinary and fecal samples were collected for up to 168 h 
      postdose. All samples were analyzed for total radioactivity by liquid 
      scintillation counting and for concentrations of edoxaban and four metabolites in 
      plasma, urine, and fecal samples by either high-performance liquid 
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method using multiple reaction modes, or 
      a liquid chromatography radiometric method. The mean recovery of radioactivity 
      was >97% of the administered radioactive dose, with 62.2% eliminated in feces and 
      35.4% in urine. Unchanged edoxaban accounted for the majority of radioactivity, 
      with 49.1 and 23.8% of the dose as parent observed in feces and urine, 
      respectively. Unchanged edoxaban was the most abundant species in plasma, with a 
      mean area under the curve (AUC)(0-∞) of 1596 ng · h/ml. The next most abundant 
      species was metabolite M4, with a mean AUC(0-∞) 147 ng · h/ml. The mass balance 
      of edoxaban was well described, with unchanged edoxaban as the most abundant 
      component of total radioactivity. Edoxaban is eliminated through multiple 
      pathways, but each accounts for only a small amount of overall elimination.

AB  - AIMS: Edoxaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 
      3 A4 (CYP3A4) and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Three edoxaban 
      drug-drug interaction studies examined the effects of P-gp inhibitors with 
      varying degrees of CYP3A4 inhibition. METHODS: In each study, healthy subjects 
      received a single oral dose of 60 mg edoxaban with or without an oral dual 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor as follows: ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days, 
      edoxaban on day 4; erythromycin 500 mg four times daily for 8 days, edoxaban on 
      day 7; or single dose of cyclosporine 500 mg with edoxaban. Serial plasma samples 
      were obtained for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Safety was assessed 
      throughout the study. RESULTS: Coadministration of ketoconazole, erythromycin, or 
      cyclosporine increased edoxaban total exposure by 87%, 85%, and 73%, 
      respectively, and the peak concentration by 89%, 68%, and 74%, respectively, 
      compared with edoxaban alone. The half-life did not change appreciably. Exposure 
      of M4, the major active edoxaban metabolite, was consistent when edoxaban was 
      administered alone or with ketoconazole and erythromycin. With cyclosporine, M4 
      total exposure increased by 6.9-fold and peak exposure by 8.7-fold, suggesting an 
      additional interaction. Pharmacodynamic effects were reflective of increased 
      edoxaban exposure. No clinically significant adverse events were observed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Administration of dual inhibitors of P-gp and CYP3A4 increased 
      edoxaban exposure by less than two-fold. This effect appears to be primarily due 
      to inhibition of P-gp. The impact of CYP3A4 inhibition appears to be less 
      pronounced, and its contribution to total clearance appears limited in healthy 
      subjects.

AB  - 1. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      single-dose edoxaban in healthy Chinese subjects. 2. This single-centre, 
      open-label, 3-occasion, cross-over study enrolled six males and six females. 
      Subjects received a single-oral-dose of edoxaban 30-90 mg in each study occasion 
      under fasting condition. Serial blood samples were collected to measure the 
      plasma concentrations of edoxaban and its major active metabolite D21-2393. 
      Meanwhile, PT, INR, aPTT were measured pre- and post-dose. Safety was assessed. 
      3. After administration, edoxaban was rapidly absorbed (median T(max )=( )1-2 h). 
      With rapid transformation, peak concentration of D21-2393 was reached within 2-h 
      post-dose. The elimination half-life of edoxaban was 5-20 h. The dose-exposure 
      relationships were slightly lower-than-dose-proportional for both edoxaban and 
      D21-2393. Although women had higher plasma exposure of edoxaban and D21-2393 than 
      men, it was considered clinically insignificant. 4. The effects of edoxaban on 
      all pharmacodynamic biomarkers were concentration-dependent and 
      linearly-correlated to plasma level of the compound. Minor bleeding was the most 
      commonly reported adverse events. 5. Single oral doses of edoxaban 30-90 mg were 
      safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese volunteers. 6. The pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles of edoxaban in Chinese subjects were comparable to those 
      observed in Caucasian and Japanese populations.

TI  - An Open-Label Crossover Study of the Pharmacokinetics of the 60-mg Edoxaban 
      Tablet Crushed and Administered Either by a Nasogastric Tube or in Apple Puree in 
      Healthy Adults.
PG  - 221-228

AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is an orally active, direct factor Xa inhibitor indicated to 
      reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. OBJECTIVES: This 
      study assessed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the edoxaban 
      60-mg tablet crushed and administered via a nasogastric tube in a water 
      suspension or orally mixed in apple puree. METHODS: This phase 1, open-label, 
      crossover study randomized 30 healthy adults to receive three edoxaban treatment 
      regimens (oral 60-mg edoxaban tablet, or 60-mg edoxaban tablet crushed and 
      administered via a nasogastric tube or orally in apple puree) in one of six 
      treatment sequences. RESULTS: Total edoxaban exposure was similar between the 
      intact and crushed tablet regimens (mean area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve from time zero to infinity: whole tablet, 2132 ng·h/mL; nasogastric tube, 
      2021 ng·h/mL; apple puree, 2076 ng·h/mL). Mean maximum plasma concentration, area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last 
      measurable concentration, terminal half-life, and apparent total body clearance 
      values were also similar. Time to maximum plasma concentration was significantly 
      shorter for the nasogastric tube suspension and apple puree vs. the whole tablet 
      [Hodges-Lehmann estimate of median difference (90% confidence interval): -0.75 
      (-1.25, -0.28); p = 0.0003 and -0.62 (-0.99, -0.26); p = 0.0024, respectively]. 
      The maximum plasma concentation, area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      from time zero to infinity, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration were similar 
      between treatment regimens; 90% confidence interval of the geometric 
      least-squares means ratios were within the predefined 80-125% bioequivalence 
      criterion. The safety and tolerability of edoxaban did not differ between 
      treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of edoxaban tablets 
      crushed and administered either via a nasogastric tube or orally mixed in apple 
      puree in patients who are unable to swallow solid oral dose formulations.

TI  - A single and multiple postprandial dose study investigating the pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban in healthy Chinese volunteers .
PG  - 256-263
LID - 10.5414/CP202737 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) 
      of once-daily postprandial doses of edoxaban 60 mg in healthy Chinese subjects. 
      METHODS: 6 male and 6 female healthy Chinese volunteers, aged 18 - 45 years, were 
      enrolled into this open-label, phase-I trial. Subjects received single oral doses 
      of edoxaban 60 mg after a meal, followed by successive once-daily doses for 
      7 days. Serial blood samples were taken pre- and postdose to measure plasma 
      concentrations of edoxaban and its major active metabolite D21-2393 as well as 
      prothrombin time (PT) and activated partialprothrombin time (aPTT). Safety was 
      assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Eoxaban was quickly absorbed after 
      dosing. The resultant maximum and total exposure of edoxaban after single 
      postprandial dose were similar to those after the same dose in fasting condition, 
      but t(max) was about half an hour longer. Meanwhile, the exposure of D21-2393 and 
      the metabolite-over-parent ratio were both lower vs. the fasting condition, 
      suggesting involvement of food on D21-2393 formation. Steady state was attained 
      after two successive daily doses. The PK parameters of edoxaban with multiple 
      postprandial doses were comparable to those observed in Caucasian and Japanese 
      volunteers. Similarly, the PD profiles and the concentration-response 
      relationship of edoxaban were not changed with repeated doses. Minor bleeding was 
      the most commonly reported adverse event during the study. CONCLUSION: Once daily 
      postprandial doses of edoxaban 60 mg was safe and well tolerated in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers. The PK and PD characteristics of edoxaban were comparable 
      among Chinese, Caucasian, and Japanese subjects. .

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) and exposure-response relationship of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Concentration data from 1,134 subjects in 11 
      clinical studies (eight phase I, one phase II, and two phase III) were used to 
      perform a population PK analysis, including estimation of the bioavailability and 
      quantification of the effects of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors as well as 
      renal impairment on edoxaban PK. The potential relationship between edoxaban PK 
      exposure and incidence of bleeding events was explored based on data from 893 AF 
      patients. RESULTS: Absolute bioavailability of edoxaban was estimated as 58.3 %. 
      With oral dosing of edoxaban, co-administration of various P-gp inhibitors 
      significantly increased edoxaban bioavailability and decreased volume of 
      distribution (V 2), resulting in a predicted increase of 33-77 % in area under 
      the curve (AUC) and 65-104 % in C max. A much smaller increase was seen in 
      edoxaban concentration at 24 h post-dose (C 24, -24 to 38 %), due to decreased V 
      2 and shortened elimination half-life. With IV dosing of edoxaban, 
      co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor quinidine decreased both edoxaban 
      clearance (CL) and V 2, resulting in an increase of 32 % in AUC and 66 % in C 24. 
      Creatinine clearance was a significant covariate on renal clearance, whereas age 
      and body weight significantly affected nonrenal clearance. Model-predicted steady 
      state C min was slightly higher, but AUC was comparable for patients who had 
      severe renal impairment and received edoxaban 15 mg once daily (QD) versus 
      patients who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment and received 
      edoxaban 30 mg QD. Exposure-response analysis suggested that edoxaban C min and 
      country/region are significantly associated with the incidence of bleeds. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The model provided reasonable estimation with regard to the absolute 
      bioavailability of edoxaban, the magnitude of change in edoxaban exposure upon 
      co-administration of P-gp inhibitors, and the impact of renal impairment on 
      edoxaban clearance. Analysis results supported a 50 % dose reduction scheme for 
      subjects with severe renal impairment. Further confirmation will be sought by 
      incorporating clinical safety and efficacy information from larger phase III 
      trials.

AB  - The oral anticoagulant edoxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, will likely be 
      coadministered with digoxin in some patients with atrial fibrillation. Both drugs 
      are substrates for P-glycoprotein. The objective of this phase 1, parallel study 
      was to assess the effects of coadministration of both drugs on their respective 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Forty-eight subjects, aged 18 to 
      45 years, received either edoxaban 60 mg once daily × 7 days (n = 24) or digoxin 
      0.25 mg twice daily × 2 days and once daily × 5 days (n = 24) and then 
      concomitantly for 7 days. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for 
      digoxin and edoxaban concentrations on days 7 and 14. Serial coagulation assays 
      were measured for edoxaban on days 7 and 14. Edoxaban PK parameters demonstrated 
      mild increases in area under the curve and peak concentrations of 9.5% and 15.6%, 
      respectively, when coadministered with digoxin. Although digoxin PK parameters 
      demonstrated increased area under the curve and peak concentrations of 8.3% and 
      28%, respectively, plasma concentrations were within the established therapeutic 
      range. Edoxaban PD were consistent with PK. Both drugs were well tolerated alone 
      or in combination. No clinically significant changes in PK, PD, or renal 
      elimination were observed with concomitant administration of edoxaban and 
      digoxin.

AB  - PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended in preference to 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) eligible for oral anticoagulation therapy; however, data and 
      clinical experiences supporting the use of DOACs in patients with a body mass 
      index ≥40 kg/m(2) or weight >120 kg remain limited. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of DOACs in patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity. METHODS: We enrolled all consecutive patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity undergoing treatment with DOACs followed up at Monaldi Hospital, Naples, 
      Italy. To determine peak plasma and trough levels of DOACs, plasma samples were 
      collected at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th hours from the last dose intake in patients 
      receiving apixaban and dabigatran and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 24th hours in 
      those receiving edoxaban and rivaroxaban. The DOACs' peak and trough plasma 
      levels obtained from our study population were compared with those sourced from 
      pharmacokinetic studies among patients without obesity, defined as a normal 
      reference range in the literature. If at least 1 peak or trough plasma level was 
      found ​​below or above the normal reference ranges, the patients were classified 
      as having out-of-range DOAC plasma levels. Study population was then divided into 
      in-range and out-of-range groups. Baseline characteristics, including DOAC 
      treatment, were compared between the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis were performed to identify baseline variables 
      associated with DOACs' plasma concentration out of the expected range. FINDINGS: 
      A total of 58 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.93 [8.73] years; 40% female) with 
      extreme obesity (mean [SD] body mass index. 44.43 [3.54] kg/m(2)) and AF while 
      undergoing DOAC treatment were included in the present study. In 9 patients (15.5 
      %), the DOAC plasma concentrations were out of the expected ranges (out-of-range 
      group);, indicating a greater likelihood of edoxaban 30 mg treatment (33% vs 2%; 
      P < 0.01) and inappropriate DOAC underdosing (56% vs 4%; P < 0.005) compared with 
      the in-range group. According to the multivariate logistic analysis (P = 0.0011), 
      the inappropriate DOAC underdosing (hazard ratio = 29.37; P = 0.0002) was an 
      independent predictor of DOAC plasma levels out of the expected ranges. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Patients with extreme obesity and AF who were receiving DOAC 
      therapy had DOAC plasma concentrations in the expected range. The inappropriate 
      DOAC underdosing seems to be the only independent clinical factor associated with 
      a plasma concentration of the drug out of the expected range.

TI  - The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in healthy adults.
PG  - 447-53
LID - 10.1007/s40261-015-0298-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The oral direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban is a 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate metabolized via carboxylesterase-1 and cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) 3A4/5. The effect of rifampin-induced induction of P-gp and CYP3A4/5 
      on transport and metabolism of edoxaban through the CYP3A4/5 pathway was 
      investigated in a single-dose edoxaban study. METHODS: This was a phase 1, 
      open-label, two-treatment, two-period, single-sequence drug interaction study in 
      healthy adults. All subjects received a single oral 60 mg edoxaban dose in period 
      1, and 7 days of 600 mg rifampin (2 × 300 mg capsules once daily) with a single 
      oral edoxaban 60 mg dose administered concomitantly on day 7 in period 2. A 6-day 
      washout period separated the treatments. Plasma concentrations of edoxaban and 
      its metabolites M4 and M6 were measured, and limited assessments of 
      pharmacodynamic markers of coagulation were performed. RESULTS: In total, 34 
      healthy subjects were enrolled; 32 completed the study. Coadministration of 
      rifampin with edoxaban decreased edoxaban exposure but increased active 
      metabolite exposure. Rifampin increased apparent oral clearance of edoxaban by 33 
      % and decreased its half-life by 50 %. Anticoagulant effects based on the 
      prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with 
      and without rifampin at early time points were maintained to a 
      greater-than-expected degree than with edoxaban exposure alone, presumably 
      because of an increased contribution from the active metabolites. Edoxaban was 
      well tolerated in this healthy adult population. CONCLUSIONS: Rifampin reduced 
      exposure to edoxaban while increasing exposure to its active metabolites M4 and 
      M6. PT and aPTT at early time points did not change appreciably; however, the 
      data should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Edoxaban was extracted from human plasma by simple protein precipitation with 
      acetonitrile, followed by quantitative determination using a liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The recoveries of edoxaban and the 
      internal standard (ticlopidine) from human plasma were >85%, and the within- and 
      between-day coefficients of variation were within 15%. The limit of 
      quantification in human plasma was 1 ng/mL. The concentration of edoxaban in 
      blood decreased at room temperature, but remained unchanged for 1 week at 4°C. On 
      the other hand, the concentration in plasma at both -20 and -80°C remained 
      unchanged for 5 months. These results indicated that blood samples should be 
      centrifuged immediately or stored at 4°C, and that plasma samples should be 
      stored below -20°C until analysis. This method was applied to human plasma 
      obtained from four patients after total knee arthroplasty. Analysis of edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics demonstrated an absorption time lag of 4h, a maximum 
      concentration of 110 ± 26 ng/mL and an oral clearance of 37 ± 16 L/h. The 
      analytical methods established in this study will be suitable for determining the 
      concentrations of edoxaban in human plasma.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of the Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral 
      Anticoagulant Edoxaban When Administered Alone or After Switching from 
      Rivaroxaban or Dabigatran Etexilate in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 127-36
LID - 10.1007/s40261-015-0357-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor. To support the possibility that patients may choose to switch 
      treatment from another nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant to edoxaban, 
      this clinical study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic effects of edoxaban after switching from rivaroxaban or 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban. METHODS: In this open-label, three-period, 
      crossover study, healthy subjects received 3 days of edoxaban 60 mg daily, 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily, followed by 
      edoxaban 60 mg on day 4. RESULTS: Day 4 edoxaban pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      similar for all treatments. The peak effect of edoxaban on prothrombin time (PT) 
      after 4 days of edoxaban only was 21.8 ± 2.46 s; after switching from rivaroxaban 
      to edoxaban, peak effect on PT was similar at 21.8 ± 2.88 s. After switching from 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban, least squares mean activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 2 h after administration was 47.6 vs 35.0 s for 
      edoxaban alone. The treatment difference was 12.8 s (95% confidence interval 
      10.5-15.1; p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis revealed that predose aPTT was elevated 
      on day 3 of dabigatran etexilate administration, and on day 4, indicating a 
      carryover effect from dabigatran. All treatments were well tolerated and there 
      were no safety concerns upon switching, with no increased risk of bleeding. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that switching to edoxaban from either 
      rivaroxaban or dabigatran etexilate at the time of the next dose is well 
      tolerated and maintains coagulation status.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban in Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial 
      Fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Study, a Phase III Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1079-90
LID - 10.1007/s40262-016-0378-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Edoxaban is a novel factor Xa inhibitor. This study characterizes 
      the population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) included in the phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, evaluates 
      covariates for the dose-exposure relationship in this population, and assesses 
      the impact of protocol-specified dose reductions on exposure using simulations. 
      METHODS: Model development was performed using NONMEM(®) and based on sparse data 
      from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study augmented with dense data from 13 phase I 
      studies to inform and stabilize the model. The influence of body weight (WT), 
      creatinine clearance (CLCR), concomitant P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, age, 
      sex, race, and NVAF on pharmacokinetic parameters was evaluated based on 
      statistical significance and clinical relevance. RESULTS: A two-compartment model 
      with first-order elimination and first-order absorption after an absorption 
      lag-time best described the data. Apparent volume and clearance terms increased 
      with increasing WT. Apparent renal clearance increased with increasing CLCR. 
      Apparent non-renal, renal, and inter-compartmental clearance terms differed 
      between phase I volunteers and NVAF patients. Asian patients were found to have 
      increased apparent central volume of distribution, bioavailability, and total 
      apparent clearance. Concomitant P-gp inhibitors increased the bioavailability 
      statistically significantly, but this did not reach clinical relevance. 
      CONCLUSION: Edoxaban disposition and the variability in this disposition, 
      including influence of covariates, after oral administration were adequately 
      characterized in patients with NVAF. The 50 % dose reduction in patients with low 
      WT (≤60 kg), moderate renal impairment (CLCR ≤50 mL/min), or concomitant P-gp 
      inhibitors led to 30 % lower exposure than in the other patients.

TI  - Effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor, in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 687-94
LID - 10.1177/0091270010370974 [doi]
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of a standard 
      high-fat meal on the single-dose (60 mg) pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban in 
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian male volunteers matched by body mass index. This 
      was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study. All 32 enrolled 
      volunteers completed the study per protocol. Both serial blood and urine samples 
      were collected, and edoxaban concentrations were analyzed by a validated liquid 
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. Activated partial thromboplastin 
      and prothrombin times were obtained as measures of pharmacodynamic effect. The 
      point estimates of the geometric mean ratios (fed/fasted) for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), 
      and C(max) demonstrated modest increases ranging from 6% to 22% across PK 
      parameters for both race cohorts. The disposition was similar in both Japanese 
      and Caucasian matched volunteers with slightly higher AUC values (ranging from 
      7%-9%) in Caucasians. There were no serious adverse events during the study. All 
      drug-related adverse events were mild and self-limited, and none were bleeding 
      related. Both Japanese and Caucasian volunteers demonstrated a modest but 
      clinically insignificant food effect. It was concluded that edoxaban can be 
      administered without regard to food.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban 
      in elderly Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation treated in one general 
      hospital.
PG  - 1001-1006
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2018.1524188 [doi]
AB  - Steady-state plasma concentrations of anticoagulants and the time since the 
      previous administration in mainly outpatients with atrial fibrillation 
      administered standard or reduced doses were analyzed for 110 elderly Japanese 
      subjects (mean age, 76 years) treated with apixaban (2.5 or 5.0 mg twice daily), 
      dabigatran etexilate (110 or 150 mg twice daily), edoxaban (30 or 60 mg once 
      daily) or rivaroxaban (10 or 15 mg once daily) at one general hospital. The 
      pharmacokinetics in patients treated with standard and reduced doses of the four 
      anticoagulants using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was compared 
      with the concentration ranges estimated using physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic modeling. Reduced doses of anticoagulants resulted in relatively 
      small pharmacokinetic variations compared with the standard dose. Statistical 
      analyses revealed that renal impairment is likely not the sole determinant factor 
      for high plasma concentrations of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. 
      Patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with the correct doses of 
      oral anticoagulants as specified in the package inserts (e.g. reduced doses for 
      elderly patients, patients with low body weights and in combination with 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs) to avoid excessive or insufficient doses of 
      direct oral anticoagulants.

AB  - AIMS: This study characterized the population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in 
      patients with symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in the 
      Hokusai-VTE phase 3 study. The impact of the protocol-specified 50% dose 
      reductions applied to patients with body weight ≤ 60 kg, creatinine clearance 
      (CL(cr)) of 30 to 50 ml min(-1) or concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitor on 
      edoxaban exposure was assessed using simulations. METHODS: The sparse data from 
      Hokusai-VTE, 9531 concentrations collected from 3707 patients, were pooled with 
      data from 13 phase 1 studies. In the analysis, the covariate relationships used 
      for dose reductions were estimated and differences between healthy subjects and 
      patients as well as additional covariate effects of age, race and gender were 
      explored based on statistical and clinical significance. RESULTS: A linear 
      two-compartment model with first order absorption preceded by a lag time best 
      described the data. Allometrically scaled body weight was included on disposition 
      parameters. Apparent clearance was parameterized as non-renal and renal. The 
      latter increased non-linearly with increasing CL(cr). Compared with healthy 
      volunteers, inter-compartmental clearance and the CL(cr) covariate effect were 
      different in patients (+64.6% and +274%). Asian patients had a 22.6% increased 
      apparent central volume of distribution. The effect of co-administration of 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitors seen in phase 1 could not be confirmed in the phase 3 
      data. Model-based simulations revealed lower exposure in dose-reduced compared 
      with non-dose-reduced patients. CONCLUSIONS: The adopted dose-reduction strategy 
      resulted in reduced exposure compared with non-dose-reduced, thereby 
      overcompensating for covariate effects. The clinical impact of these differences 
      on safety and efficacy remains to be evaluated.

      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 743-52
LID - 10.1007/s40261-014-0229-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Edoxaban is a novel direct inhibitor of activated 
      factor Xa. A previous human pharmacokinetic study suggested a less than 
      proportional increase in edoxaban exposure at higher dose concentrations, but the 
      quantitative relationship, including the point of inflection, has not yet been 
      fully characterized. The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the 
      population pharmacokinetics and quantify the dose-exposure relationship of 
      edoxaban over a dose range of 10-180 mg. METHODS: Concentration data from 278 
      subjects in five phase I clinical studies were used to perform a population 
      pharmacokinetic analysis using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Model 
      performance was assessed by standard goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots, visual 
      predictive check, and bootstrapping procedures. RESULTS: Edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics were described by a two-compartment model, with first-order 
      absorption preceded by a lag time for absorption (t lag). Edoxaban relative 
      bioavailability (F 1) was estimated as 67.2 % and remained constant at the dose 
      range of 10-30 mg. For doses above 30 mg, every 30-mg dose increase was 
      associated with an approximately 6.7 % decrease in F 1. Sex was identified as a 
      significant covariate on clearance (CL), with female subjects showing 13.1 % 
      lower CL than male subjects. Food was found to affect t lag, but not F 1. When 
      compared with the fasted state, administration of edoxaban with food prolonged t 
      lag from 0.233 to 0.375 h. CONCLUSIONS: The population pharmacokinetic model 
      provided an adequate description of the observed data. The analysis results 
      suggested a less than proportional dose-exposure relationship for edoxaban at a 
      dose above 30 mg. A statistically significant sex effect on CL and food effect on 
      t lag were identified but are unlikely to be clinically important.

TI  - Sustained safe and effective anticoagulation using Edoxaban via percutaneous 
      endoscopic gastrostomy.
PG  - 884-888
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.12434 [doi]
AB  - Extensive data support the safety of direct oral anticoagulants compared with 
      vitamin K antagonists in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, leading 
      to a significantly increase in the use of these compounds in clinical practice. 
      However, there is no compelling evidence supporting the use of direct oral 
      anticoagulant in individuals who are intubated or have a percutaneous endoscopic 
      gastrostomy (PEG): patients with several co-morbidities are underrepresented in 
      clinical trials, so the best long-term strategy for anticoagulation is difficult 
      to ascertain. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the safety and 
      efficacy of edoxaban administered via PEG in a patient with heart failure and a 
      history of atrial fibrillation affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 
      71-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, advanced ALS, type II diabetes 
      mellitus, and hypertension presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea 
      and tachycardia. Because vitamin K antagonist and rivaroxaban 15 mg were dropped 
      because of difficult international normalized ratio control (time in therapeutic 
      range <30%) and severe haematuria, respectively, edoxaban 30 mg (crushed pill) 
      daily was administered based on the patient's weight of 58 kg. Mean edoxaban 
      plasma concentration-time profiles were measured, as anti-Xa activity, 2 h before 
      and at 2, 6, and 22 h after drug administration and then compared with the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of edoxaban 30 mg in healthy subjects. An additional 
      testing of steady-state peak plasma concentration of edoxaban after 10 days and a 
      30 day follow-up were evaluated. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      analysed with a non-compartmental analysis by PKSolver module, showed that C(max) 
      and AUC(0→t) were only slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects, 
      while the half-life and observed clearance were significantly longer and lower, 
      respectively, than in normal subjects. Steady-state peak plasma concentration of 
      edoxaban was very similar to the levels reported in healthy subjects, and neither 
      relevant bleeding nor thromboembolic event was reported at a 30 day follow-up. 
      These results support safe and effective anticoagulation with edoxaban 30 mg but 
      suggest caution with the use of full dose of edoxaban (60 mg daily) in this kind 
      of patients. We report, for the first time, a safe and effective anticoagulation 
      based on the administration of edoxaban 30 mg daily through PEG in a patient with 
      advanced ALS, acute respiratory, and heart failure, presenting with Takotsubo 
      syndrome and atrial fibrillation.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
      of edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, in healthy subjects switching 
      from warfarin. METHODS: Seventy-two subjects were randomized to edoxaban 60 mg 
      once daily (n = 48) or matching placebo (n = 24) for 5 days at 24 h after the 
      last dose of warfarin treatment (INR 2.0 to 3.0). Safety/tolerability was the 
      primary outcome measure. Pharmacokinetics, INR, aPTT, anti-FXa, thrombin 
      generation and other coagulation assays were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-two 
      subjects were randomized and 64 subjects received at least one dose of edoxaban 
      (n = 43) or placebo (n = 21) after achieving a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 on 
      warfarin treatment. Edoxaban 60 mg administered 24 h post-warfarin appeared to be 
      safe and well tolerated. Adverse events were similar across treatments. For 
      bleeding-related adverse events, eight subjects tested positive for faecal occult 
      blood, five subjects during warfarin treatment and three subjects during edoxaban 
      treatment. The mean (SD) baseline (post-dose of warfarin) INR was 2.31 (0.193) 
      which increased to 3.84 (0.744) over 2 h during the edoxaban treatment (P < 
      0.0001 vs. placebo), returning to post-warfarin baseline within 12 h. A similar 
      time course of effects for the other coagulation assays was observed in 
      accordance with the drugs' mechanisms of action. CONCLUSION: In this study of 
      healthy subjects, edoxaban administered 24 h after the last dose of warfarin was 
      safe and well tolerated with transient increases across the various coagulation 
      assays above post-warfarin baseline levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor under 
      investigation for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and for 
      treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. This study 
      evaluated edoxaban absolute bioavailability and effects of the P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitor quinidine on edoxaban pharmacokinetics after intravenous edoxaban 
      administration. METHODS: Healthy volunteers received three treatments in a 
      randomized sequence: single oral 60-mg edoxaban dose, single intravenous 30-mg 
      edoxaban dose, and concomitant single intravenous 30-mg edoxaban dose with 
      quinidine 300 mg every 8 hours for 4 days. The primary objective was to determine 
      absolute bioavailability of edoxaban. Secondary objectives included 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban after oral or intravenous 
      administration, quinidine effect on intravenous edoxaban pharmacokinetics, and 
      safety. RESULTS: Thirty-six subjects were randomized; five discontinued (three 
      for adverse events [AEs]). Edoxaban oral absolute bioavailability was 61.8%. With 
      concomitant quinidine, total edoxaban exposure increased ∼35% and total clearance 
      decreased ∼25%. Coagulation parameters increased after edoxaban administration in 
      most subjects, but returned to baseline within 24 hours postdose. No deaths, 
      serious AEs, or bleeding-related AEs occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute 
      bioavailability of edoxaban in healthy volunteers was established (61.8%). 
      Edoxaban, administered orally or intravenously, appeared to be safe and well 
      tolerated.

AB  - Edoxaban is an oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, an elderly population that 
      frequently receives aspirin (ASA) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 
      concurrent illnesses. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of edoxaban 60 mg coadministered 
      with low-dose (100 mg) ASA, high-dose (325 mg) ASA, or naproxen (500 mg) in 
      healthy subjects (n = 126). Template bleeding times (BT) were measured. Mean 
      baseline (predose) BT for the 3 studies ranged from 4.72 to 6.13 minutes. 
      Edoxaban administered alone increased BT by 21%-35% (4 hours post dose) from 
      baseline. Concomitant administration of edoxaban with high-dose ASA, low-dose 
      ASA, or naproxen increased BT approximately 2-fold showing an additive effect 
      greater than either agent administered alone. Edoxaban pharmacokinetics were not 
      affected by concomitant low-dose ASA or naproxen, but high-dose ASA increased 
      systemic exposure of edoxaban by approximately 30%. The effects of edoxaban on 
      prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized 
      ratio, anti-FXa, and intrinsic FXa activity were not influenced by administration 
      with ASA or naproxen. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by high-dose ASA, 
      low-dose ASA, or naproxen was not affected by edoxaban. Concomitant 
      administration of edoxaban and ASA or naproxen was well tolerated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticoagulant actions of oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors 
      can be inferred from their observed plasma concentrations; however, the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of different FXa inhibitors have not been 
      compared in clinically. METHODS: The sensitivity of the rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban in the STA-Liquid Anti-FXa assay were compared, and the anti-FXa 
      plasma concentrations were measured for PK assessments. Nonlinear mixed-effects 
      modeling was used to assess population PK in 329 patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Patients were followed up for an average 
      of 3.6 years. RESULTS: Sensitivity was similar among the three drugs in this 
      assay, which could directly compare plasma concentrations instead of anti-FXa 
      activities. Overall exposure was greatest in 5 mg BID apixaban relative to other 
      drugs (p < 0.001). The geometric mean AUC for the 0 to 24-h interval was 
      4550 ng h/mL for apixaban, 2710 ng h/mL for 15 mg QD rivaroxaban, and 
      1290 ng h/mL for 60 mg QD edoxaban. The PKs of 2.5 mg BID apixaban or 15 mg QD 
      rivaroxaban were associated with hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was 
      associated with greater exposure, higher trough concentrations in plasma compared 
      with rivaroxaban or edoxaban. Furthermore, a higher plasma concentration may 
      partially predict hemorrhagic events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased 7-fold in 
      patients with cancer than in those without. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the 
      standard treatment for cancer-associated VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      are not inferior to low-molecular-weight heparin with respect to the general 
      outcome of recurrent VTE. Warfarin is associated with a risk of bleeding when 
      used in combination with gefitinib or erlotinib which are epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). It is unclear, however, 
      whether combination treatments with EGFR-TKIs and DOACs pose the same risk. We 
      aimed to identify anticancer drugs and anticoagulants that can be used safely in 
      combination, as accompanying research to an observational study on VTE incidence 
      rates in lung cancer patients (Rising-VTE/NEJ037 study). METHODS: Twelve patients 
      receiving EFGR-TKI monotherapy and VTE treatment were enrolled. Blood samples 
      were collected in time series after the first dose of edoxaban, and further 
      samples were collected within 8-15 days after administering EGFR-TKIs. The 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban were analyzed using a non-compartmental model. 
      RESULTS: Edoxaban concentrations (30 mg once daily) were measured in eight 
      patients. PK analyses showed no significant differences before and after 
      co-administration of EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings indicate that the PK of edoxaban was not considerably affected by 
      co-administration of EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib).

      (n = 90), including patients with SRI, were used to update the ENGAGE PopPK model 
      that had been developed based on pooled data from the phase 3 ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 
      study and 13 phase 1 PK studies, which included few patients with SRI. The final 
      model indicated that the ENGAGE PopPK model was applicable to Japanese patients 
      in that the model-simulated and study-observed concentration-time profiles were 
      in agreement. Estimated model parameters after the addition of Japanese SRI data 
      were consistent with those derived from the original ENGAGE PopPK data set. The 
      model-predicted exposure in NVAF patients with SRI who received edoxaban at a 
      15-mg, once-daily dose was similar to that in patients with normal renal function 
      or with mild renal impairment receiving a 30-mg dose. This suggests that efficacy 
      and safety data from the ENGAGE AF study can be used to support dose setting for 
      NVAF patients with SRI.

TI  - Plasma Concentration and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban in Patients with 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Heart Failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles and safety of edoxaban in patients with nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who were hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF). 
      METHODS: The trough plasma concentrations of edoxaban, and the coagulation 
      biomarkers prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1+2) and D-dimer, were determined. 
      Twenty-six patients received edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg when dose adjustment was 
      required) and blood samples were collected immediately before oral edoxaban 
      administration for 7 consecutive days after hospitalization and on the day of 
      discharge. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 13 (range 7-46) days. Trough 
      plasma concentrations of edoxaban were constant from day 2 onwards. On day 1, the 
      variation was greater owing to the differing intervals between the last edoxaban 
      dose and day 1 blood collection. Trough plasma concentrations were higher in 
      patients with reduced creatinine clearance (≤ 50 mL/min). Median values for F1+2 
      and D-dimer remained within normal ranges throughout the study. There were no 
      drug discontinuations, and no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This is the first study of edoxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in 
      patients with NVAF and AHF, and shows that the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles of edoxaban were constant during hospitalization. Thus, 
      even in patients with NVAF and AHF, edoxaban anticoagulation therapy with guided 
      dose adjustment is considered to be a safe and appropriate intervention. In 
      particular, patients with reduced creatinine clearance should adhere to dose 
      adjustment criteria. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: jRCTs031190006 (Japan Registry 
      of Clinical Trials), 5 April, 2019 retrospectively registered.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of anticoagulant edoxaban in overdose in a Japanese patient 
      transported to hospital.
PG  - 20

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticoagulant edoxaban is used clinically at doses of 
      30-60 mg/day; however, we experienced a patient who had taken an overdose of 
      edoxaban of 750 mg. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in this 
      patient by using liquid chromatography-tandem spectrometry to estimate the 
      follow-up period in emergency clinical practice with this medicine. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: The patient was a 57-year-old woman (body weight, 69 kg) who had 
      taken a single oral dose of 750 mg of edoxaban in a suicide attempt. She was 
      emergently admitted to Kyoto Medical Center. The patient's edoxaban plasma 
      concentrations during ambulance transport (8 h after oral administration) 
      were ~ 4900 ng/ml, and the concentration gradually decreased to ~ 10 ng/mL and to 
      detectable but unmeasurable levels of ~ 1.0 ng/mL at 60 h and 100 h, 
      respectively. The linear range of the relationship between the dose and plasma 
      concentration was assumed to have been exceeded during the first 8 h; however, 
      the measured elimination rate of edoxaban was similar to that visualized curves 
      predicted by a simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic model previously 
      established. CONCLUSION: Simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic models 
      for creating visualized curves have proven to be useful not only during drug 
      discovery or chemical risk assessment but also in cases of medical poisoning. We 
      used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model previously established for 
      edoxaban to predict the pharmacokinetics in the current case. It is hoped that 
      the results of this study, which encompass drug monitoring data in the patient 
      and visualized pharmacokinetic prediction, will serve as an index when setting 
      the treatment and follow-up period in cases of drug overdose for medicines such 
      as edoxaban in emergency clinical practice.

TI  - Drug-drug interaction studies of cardiovascular drugs involving P-glycoprotein, 
      an efflux transporter, on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban, an oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor.
PG  - 331-42
LID - 10.1007/s40256-013-0029-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is in development for 
      thromboprophylaxis, including prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux 
      transporter, modulates absorption and excretion of xenobiotics. Edoxaban is a 
      P-gp substrate, and several cardiovascular (CV) drugs have the potential to 
      inhibit P-gp and increase drug exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential 
      pharmacokinetic interactions of edoxaban and 6 cardiovascular drugs used in the 
      management of AF and known P-gp substrates/inhibitors. METHODS: Drug-drug 
      interaction studies with edoxaban and CV drugs with known P-gp 
      substrate/inhibitor potential were conducted in healthy subjects. In 4 crossover, 
      2-period, 2-treatment studies, subjects received edoxaban 60 mg alone and 
      coadministered with quinidine 300 mg (n = 42), verapamil 240 mg (n = 34), 
      atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 32), or dronedarone 400 mg (n = 34). Additionally, 
      edoxaban 60 mg alone and coadministered with amiodarone 400 mg (n = 30) or 
      digoxin 0.25 mg (n = 48) was evaluated in a single-sequence study and 2-cohort 
      study, respectively. RESULTS: Edoxaban exposure measured as area under the curve 
      increased for concomitant administration of edoxaban with quinidine (76.7 %), 
      verapamil (52.7 %), amiodarone (39.8 %), and dronedarone (84.5 %), and exposure 
      measured as 24-h concentrations for quinidine (11.8 %), verapamil (29.1 %), and 
      dronedarone (157.6 %) also increased. Administration of edoxaban with amiodarone 
      decreased the 24-h concentration for edoxaban by 25.7 %. Concomitant 
      administration with digoxin or atorvastatin had minimal effects on edoxaban 
      exposure. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of the P-gp inhibitors quinidine, 
      verapamil, and dronedarone increased edoxaban exposure. Modest/minimal effects 
      were observed for amiodarone, atorvastatin, and digoxin.

AB  - Edoxaban, a once-daily, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for stroke 
      prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism 
      treatment. This study examined the effects of mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
      on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and its metabolite M4. Thirty-three subjects 
      enrolled in 4 treatment cohorts-mild hepatic impairment (n = 8), moderate hepatic 
      impairment (n = 9), and 2 cohorts of healthy controls matched for age, sex, and 
      weight (each n = 8)-and received a single 15-mg dose of edoxaban. Plasma 
      pharmacokinetics for edoxaban and M4, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT), and safety data were measured over 72 hours. Edoxaban 
      and M4 exposures were similar in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
      impairment compared with matched controls. Higher PT and aPTT values were 
      observed at baseline and after edoxaban dosing in the hepatic impairment groups 
      compared with healthy controls. Edoxaban 15 mg was well tolerated in all cohorts. 
      These results suggest that edoxaban exposure does not significantly increase in 
      patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, because of the 
      potential for underlying coagulopathy, edoxaban is not recommended for use in 
      patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. No dose reduction is 
      recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      efflux on edoxaban absorption in gastrointestinal tracts quantitatively by a 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model constructed with clinical and 
      non-clinical observations (using GastroPlus™ software). An absorption process was 
      described by the advanced compartmental absorption and transit model with the 
      P-gp function. A human PBPK model was constructed by integrating the clinical and 
      non-clinical observations. The constructed model was demonstrated to reproduce 
      the data observed in the mass-balance study. Thus, elimination pathways can be 
      quantitatively incorporated into the model. A constructed model successfully 
      described the difference in slopes of plasma concentration (Cp)-time curve at 
      around 8 - 24 hr post-dose between intravenous infusion and oral administration. 
      Furthermore, the model without P-gp efflux activity can reproduce the Cp-time 
      profile in the absence of P-gp activity observed from the clinical DDI study 
      results. Since the difference of slopes between intravenous infusion and oral 
      administration also disappeared by the absence of P-gp efflux activity, P-gp must 
      be a key molecule to govern edoxaban's PK behavior. The constructed PBPK model 
      will help us to understand the significant contribution of P-gp in edoxaban's 
      disposition in gastrointestinal tracts quantitatively.

TI  - Effects of concomitant use of prasugrel with edoxaban on bleeding time, 
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in healthy elderly Japanese 
      male subjects: a clinical pharmacology study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dual therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plus a P2Y(12) 
      receptor inhibitor is recommended in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Thus, we evaluated 
      the effects of DOAC edoxaban plus P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor prasugrel on 
      bleeding time (BT), and pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      edoxaban in healthy elderly Japanese male subjects. METHODS: A single-center, 
      clinical pharmacology study with randomized, open-label, repeated dosing enrolled 
      24 participants in two groups of 12 receiving 30 mg edoxaban once daily for 
      3 days; then 30 mg edoxaban plus 2.5 mg prasugrel (Group 1) or 30 mg edoxaban 
      plus 3.75 mg prasugrel (Group 2) once daily for 5 days. Primary endpoint was BT 
      by the Ivy method. Secondary endpoints were the PD parameters of prothrombin time 
      (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 
      (F1 + 2), and P2Y(12) reaction units (PRU), and PK profiles of edoxaban alone and 
      in combination with prasugrel. RESULTS: Geometric least squares mean of BT ratios 
      (vs. baseline) for 3-day edoxaban treatment were 1.097 (90% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.911-1.321) in Group 1 and 1.327 (90% CI 1.035-1.703) in Group 2; for 5-day 
      edoxaban plus 2.5 mg and 3.75 mg prasugrel, they were 1.581 (90% CI 1.197-2.087) 
      and 1.996 (90% CI 1.482-2.690), respectively. Contributions of prasugrel to the 
      effects (edoxaban + prasugrel/edoxaban) were 1.442 (90% CI 1.096-1.897) in Group 
      1 and 1.504 (90% CI 1.172-1.930) in Group 2. Edoxaban prolonged PT and aPTT and 
      decreased F1 + 2. Adding on prasugrel did not appreciably change PT, aPTT, or 
      F1 + 2. Prasugrel reduced PRU, whereas edoxaban had no effect on PRU. We recorded 
      26 adverse events; 23 were treatment-emergent (positive fecal occult blood test). 
      All participants with adverse events recovered during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coadministration of 2.5 mg and 3.75 mg prasugrel with 30 mg edoxaban prolonged BT 
      in healthy elderly Japanese male subjects. The effect was dependent on the dose 
      of prasugrel. Prasugrel did not affect PD or PK profiles of edoxaban. Edoxaban 
      had no effect on PD of prasugrel. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of Clinical 
      Trials No. jRCTs071190006; registration date, 26-April-2019.

AB  - The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, as well as the direct factor Xa 
      inhibtors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, display pharmacodynamic features 
      quite similar to low-molecular-weight heparins, with a time to peak level of 1-4 
      hours after oral administration, and a half-life between 5 and 14 hours. All 
      drugs display a linear relationship and a high degree of correlation between drug 
      levels in plasma, and the anticoagulant effect. Major differences are the extent 
      of renal elimination (with 80% or more for dabigatran, 66% for rivaroxaban [33% 
      unchanged, active drug, and 33% inactive metabolites], 33% for edoxaban, and 
      finally, 25% for apixaban), and bioavailability, which determines the amount of 
      drug required for attaining the target plasma concentration of the drug. Due to 
      the reliable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, no routine laboratory 
      monitoring is necessary, although dedicated laboratory assays are available for 
      emergencies and some other specific conditions.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling analysis of intrinsic FXa and 
      bleeding from edoxaban treatment.
PG  - 910-6
LID - 10.1002/jcph.306 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor that has been 
      evaluated for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence. 
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and logistic regression 
      analyses were used to explore the clinical data from phase 1 and 2 studies to 
      determine the relationship among PK exposure, PD response, and bleeding risk. 
      Population PK/PD modeling was performed using plasma edoxaban concentration data 
      from combined phase 1 and 2 studies and using intrinsic FXa data from a phase 2 
      AF study. A 2-compartment PK model adequately described the combined PK data, and 
      a dynamic binding model characterized the dynamics of the intrinsic factor X 
      activity (iFXa) data. Logistic regression analysis then identified the 
      relationship between the iFXa and the observed bleeding risk. The more protracted 
      suppression of FXa over the dosing interval for a 30-mg twice-daily dose compared 
      with a 60-mg once-daily dose offers an explanation for the significantly higher 
      bleeding rate at the former dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Factor Xa (FXa), a key serine protease that converts prothrombin to 
      thrombin in the coagulation cascade, is a promising target enzyme for the 
      prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. DU-176b is a novel 
      antithrombotic agent that directly inhibits FXa activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      the in vitro pharmacological profiles and in vivo effects of DU-176b in animal 
      models of thrombosis and bleeding. METHODS: In vitro, FXa inhibition, specificity 
      and anticoagulant activities were examined. Oral absorption was studied in rats 
      and cynomolgus monkeys. In vivo effects were studied in rat and rabbit models of 
      venous thrombosis and tail bleeding. RESULTS: DU-176b inhibited FXa with Ki 
      values of 0.561 nm for free FXa, 2.98 nm for prothrombinase, and exhibited >10 
      000-fold selectivity for FXa. In human plasma, DU-176b doubled prothrombin time 
      and activated partial thromboplastin time at concentrations of 0.256 and 0.508 
      microm, respectively. DU-176b did not impair platelet aggregation by ADP, 
      collagen or U46619. DU-176b was highly absorbed in rats and monkeys, as 
      demonstrated by more potent anti-Xa activity and higher drug concentration in 
      plasma following oral administration than a prototype FXa inhibitor, DX-9065a. In 
      vivo, DU-176b dose-dependently inhibited thrombus formation in rat and rabbit 
      thrombosis models, although bleeding time in rats was not significantly prolonged 
      at an antithrombotic dose. CONCLUSIONS: DU-176b is a more potent and selective 
      FXa inhibitor with high oral bioavailability compared with its prototype, 
      DX-9065a. DU-176b represents a promising new anticoagulant for the prophylaxis 
      and treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a once-daily, non-vitamin 
      K antagonist oral anticoagulant. There is no established method to reverse the 
      activity of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in cases of hemorrhage or urgent 
      surgery. This study evaluated the ability of a 3-factor prothrombin complex 
      concentrate (3F-PCC) to reverse the anticoagulatory effects of edoxaban. METHODS: 
      In this phase 1 study, 24 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 
      single dose of 60 or 180mg edoxaban, followed by placebo, 25IU/kg 3F-PCC, or 
      50IU/kg 3F-PCC. Edoxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including the 
      primary endpoint of prothrombin time (PT) and endogenous thrombin potential 
      (ETP), were assessed. D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 (F1+2) were also 
      measured. RESULTS: Overall, there were no apparent consistent effects of 3F-PCC 
      on edoxaban pharmacokinetics. Administration of 3F-PCC 25 or 50IU/kg with 
      edoxaban 60 or 180mg did not substantially accelerate the return of PT to 
      baseline levels. However, infusion of 3F-PCC 25 and 50IU/kg did substantially 
      accelerate return to baseline of ETP compared with placebo. D-dimer and F1+2 data 
      did not indicate any lasting procoagulant effects of 3F-PCC infusion, although a 
      transient increase in F1+2 was noted during and after 3F-PCC infusion. Edoxaban 
      and 3F-PCC co-administration was well tolerated in normal healthy subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no apparent reversal of PT prolongation with 3F-PCC 
      following edoxaban infusion, but ETP was completely reversed. Co-administration 
      of 3F-PCC was well tolerated, but a dose-dependent increase in F1+2 may reflect a 
      procoagulant risk.

TI  - Effect of edoxaban on markers of coagulation in venous and shed blood compared 
      with fondaparinux.
PG  - 1080-90
LID - 10.1160/TH10-11-0705 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor, is in phase III clinical 
      development for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism. The shed blood model allows for study of activated coagulation 
      at a site of standardised tissue injury due to local release of tissue factor. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three doses of edoxaban 
      on markers of coagulation in shed and venous blood versus placebo and a standard 
      prophylactic dose of fondaparinux. A total of 100 healthy male subjects were 
      randomised to receive single doses of one of five treatments: subcutaneously 
      administered fondaparinux 2.5 mg; orally administered edoxaban 30, 60, or 120 mg; 
      or placebo. The primary objective was measurement of blood coagulation markers 
      prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, and 
      platelet activation marker β-thromboglobulin (β-TG), in venous and shed blood. 
      Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics, shed blood volume, and safety of 
      edoxaban. Single doses of edoxaban caused rapid and significant decreases of 
      F1+2, TAT, and β-TG in the shed blood model, indicating inhibition of thrombin 
      generation and platelet activation. Inhibition was significantly less for 
      fondaparinux versus edoxaban. Baseline-corrected F1+2, TAT, and β-TG values 
      demonstrated sustained inhibition up to 24 hours for shed blood in the edoxaban 
      groups but no significant inhibition in venous blood. Overall, edoxaban 
      treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, single oral doses of edoxaban 30, 
      60, or 120 mg caused rapid and sustained inhibition of coagulation up to 24 hours 
      in the shed blood model.

TI  - Microdosed Cocktail of Three Oral Factor Xa Inhibitors to Evaluate Drug-Drug 
      Interactions with Potential Perpetrator Drugs.
PG  - 1155-1163
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00749-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to prove the suitability of simultaneously 
      administered microdoses of the factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban (100 µg in total). To evaluate drug-drug interactions, the impact of 
      ketoconazole, a known strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, 
      was studied. METHODS: In a crossover clinical trial, 18 healthy volunteers were 
      randomized to the two treatments using microdoses of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban alone and when coadministered with ketoconazole. Plasma and urine 
      concentrations of microdosed apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were quantified 
      using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification of 2.5 pg/ml. RESULTS: 
      The microdosed FXaI cocktail showed similar pharmacokinetic parameters compared 
      with published data, using normal therapeutic doses of each FXaI. Ketoconazole 
      significantly increased exposure, with geometric mean AUC ratios of 1.90 
      (apixaban), 2.35 (edoxaban) and 2.27 (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSION: The microdosed 
      FXaI cocktail approach was able to precisely predict the drug interaction with 
      ketoconazole. This is the first study that has been conducted to evaluate 
      drug-drug interactions with a drug class, and the low administered doses also 
      allow evaluation in vulnerable target populations. STUDY PROTOCOL: EudraCT

TI  - Effective reversal of edoxaban-associated bleeding with four-factor prothrombin 
      complex concentrate in a rabbit model of acute hemorrhage.
PG  - 387-98
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000000520 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is an oral, selective direct factor Xa inhibitor approved in 
      Japan for venous thromboembolism prevention after orthopedic surgery. Data are 
      lacking regarding reversal strategies for edoxaban; this study assessed whether 
      four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (Beriplex/Kcentra; CSL Behring GmbH, 
      Marburg, Germany) can effectively reverse its effects on hemostasis using a 
      previously described rabbit model. METHODS: The study comprised assessments of 
      thrombin generation in vitro, pharmacokinetic parameters, and edoxaban reversal 
      in vivo. In a blinded in vivo stage, a standardized kidney incision was performed 
      in animals (n = 11 per group) randomized to receive vehicle + saline, edoxaban 
      (1,200 μg/kg) + saline, or edoxaban (1,200 μg/kg) + four-factor prothrombin 
      complex concentrate (50 IU/kg). Animals were monitored for treatment impact on 
      hemostasis and coagulation parameters. Data are median (range). Statistical tests 
      were adjusted for multiple testing. RESULTS: Edoxaban administration increased 
      blood loss (30 [2 to 44] ml) and time to hemostasis (23 [8.5 to 30.0] min) 
      compared with the control group (3 [1 to 8] ml and 3 [2.0 to 5.0] min, 
      respectively). Biomarkers of coagulation (prothrombin time, activated partial 
      thromboplastin time, whole blood clotting time) and thrombin generation 
      parameters (e.g., peak thrombin, endogenous thrombin potential, lag time) were 
      also affected by edoxaban. Administration of four-factor prothrombin complex 
      concentrate significantly reduced time to hemostasis (to 8 [6.5 to 14.0] min, 
      observed P < 0.0001) and total blood loss (to 9 [4 to 22] ml, observed P = 
      0.0050) compared with the edoxaban + saline group. Of the biomarkers tested, 
      prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time, and endogenous thrombin potential 
      correlated best with clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: In a rabbit model of 
      hemostasis, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate administration 
      significantly decreased edoxaban-associated hemorrhage.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, two-treatment study 
      assessed the relationship between edoxaban equivalent concentration derived from 
      an anti-FXa assay with the summed concentration of edoxaban and its active 
      metabolite, M-4, as assessed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). This study also assessed the relationship between 
      edoxaban plasma concentrations assessed by LC/MS/MS in sodium citrate and lithium 
      heparin tubes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers were randomized to 
      receive once-daily edoxaban 60mg or 90mg for 5days (15 participants per treatment 
      group). Serial blood samples were collected for analysis by LC/MS/MS and by the 
      anti-FXa assay. Edoxaban equivalent levels were assessed using a commercially 
      available anti-FXa activity assay with an edoxaban-specific setup. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: The day 5 concentration estimates were significantly correlated 
      between the 2 assays (P<0.0001 for both edoxaban doses). The geometric least 
      squares mean (GLSM) ratio (90% confidence interval) for edoxaban equivalent 
      concentrations vs edoxaban + M-4 concentrations was 114.3% (108.2-120.8) for 
      edoxaban 60mg (P<0.0001) and 113.0% (107.1-119.2) for edoxaban 90mg (P=0.0002). 
      The GLSM ratio for edoxaban concentrations in sodium citrate vs lithium heparin 
      tubes for 60-mg and 90-mg edoxaban doses were 82.8% (78.5-87.3) and 83.9% 
      (79.1-89.0), respectively. In this study, an anti-FXa chromogenic assay with 
      edoxaban-specific calibrators and controls demonstrated good accuracy in 
      estimating edoxaban concentrations across a wide range of concentrations relative 
      to LC/MS/MS at steady state following the administration of once-daily edoxaban 
      for 5days.

TI  - An integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomic analysis of ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 
      polymorphisms on edoxaban exposure.
PG  - 153-159
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2016.82 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban and its low-abundance, active metabolite M4 are substrates of 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR1) and organic anion transporter protein 1B1 (OATP1B1), 
      respectively, and pharmacological inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 can affect 
      edoxaban and M4 pharmacokinetics (PK). In this integrated pharmacogenomic 
      analysis, genotype and concentration-time data from 458 healthy volunteers in 14 
      completed phase 1 studies were pooled to examine the impact on edoxaban PK 
      parameters of allelic variants of ABCB1 (rs1045642: C3435T) and SLCO1B1 
      (rs4149056: T521C), which encode for P-gp and OATP1B1. Although some 
      pharmacologic inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 increase edoxaban exposure, neither 
      the ABCB1 C3435T nor the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism affected edoxaban PK. A 
      slight elevation in M4 exposure was observed among SLCO1B1 C-allele carriers; 
      however, this elevation is unlikely to be clinically significant as plasma M4 
      concentrations comprise <10% of total edoxaban levels.

PG  - 238-245
LID - 10.1160/TH16-03-0224 [doi]
AB  - Of the new direct oral anticoagulants, direct factor Xa inhibitors are limited by 
      the absence of a proven reversal agent. We assessed the safety, tolerability and 
      impact on anticoagulation reversal of ciraparantag (PER977) alone and following a 
      60 mg dose of the FXa inhibitor edoxaban. Escalating, single IV doses of 
      ciraparantag were administered alone and following a 60 mg oral dose of edoxaban 
      in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to healthy subjects. Serial 
      assessments of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ciraparantag 
      were performed. Eighty male subjects completed the study. Following edoxaban (60 
      mg), a single IV dose of ciraparantag (100 to 300 mg) demonstrated full reversal 
      of anticoagulation within 10 minutes and sustained for 24 hours. Fibrin diameter 
      within clots was restored to normal 30 minutes after a single dose of 100 to 300 
      mg ciraparantag as determined by scanning electron microscopy and change in 
      fibrin diameter quantified by automated image analysis. Potentially related 
      adverse events were periorbital and facial flushing and cool sensation following 
      IV injection of ciraparantag. Renal excretion of ciraparantag metabolite was the 
      main elimination route. There was no evidence of procoagulant activity following 
      ciraparantag as assessed by D-dimer, prothrombin fragments 1.2, and tissue factor 
      pathway inhibitor levels. In conclusion, ciraparantag in healthy subjects is safe 
      and well tolerated with minor, non-dose limiting adverse events. Baseline 
      haemostasis was restored from the anticoagulated state with doses of 100 to 300 
      mg ciraparantag within 10-30 minutes of administration and sustained for at least 
      24 hours.

TI  - Responses of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time to 
      edoxaban in Japanese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: 
      characteristics of representative reagents in Japan (CVI ARO 7).
PG  - 2011-2020

AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the distribution of plasma concentration 
      of edoxaban (PC-Ed) with their 90% interval (on therapy range) and its 
      correlation with anticoagulation markers in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF). Consecutive 97 NVAF patients under edoxaban therapy were 
      evaluated (60/30 mg dose, n = 48/49; men/women, n = 71/26; age, 69 years). 
      CHADS(2) score 0, 1, and ≥ 2 were 27%, 44%, and 29%, respectively. The mean (90% 
      interval) of PC-Ed by LC-MS/MS was 194.3 (49.4-345.3) and 17.0 (4.8-40.7) ng/mL 
      at peak (2-4 h post-dose) and trough (pre-dose), respectively. Correlation of 
      prothrombin time (PT) with PC-Ed was higher than that of activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT). Among 6 PT reagents, Coagupia PT-N and Simplastin 
      Excel S (both PT reagents) showed the highest predictive capability for the upper 
      outlier of PC-Ed at peak and trough. Among 4 aPTT reagents, only Thrombocheck 
      APTT measured at peak had a significant predictive capability. When using PT 
      reagents, both peak and trough sampling showed a similar predictive capability 
      for the upper outliers of PC-Ed with a high sensitivity, but a relatively low 
      specificity. We demonstrated the distributions of plasma concentration, PT with 6 
      reagents, and aPTT with 4 reagents under edoxaban therapy in Japanese patients 
      with NVAF, showing their 90% intervals. For predicting the upper outlier of 
      PC-Ed, PT was more sensitive compared with aPTT, whereas predicting capability 
      for the outliers of PC-Ed was mostly similar between peak and trough samplings 
      among PT reagents (UMIN 000032492).

TI  - Characterisation of exposure versus response of edoxaban in patients undergoing 
      total hip replacement surgery.
PG  - 887-95
LID - 10.1160/TH12-03-0184 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Japan. The objectives of this analysis were to 
      characterise the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban and the 
      relationships between edoxaban exposure and clinical outcomes in a phase IIb 
      study of surgical patients following total hip replacement (THR). A total of 
      1,795 subjects from a phase IIb study, 10 phase I studies, and three phase IIa 
      studies were included in the PK analysis. The exposure-response analysis included 
      data from surgical patients assigned to edoxaban in the phase IIb study. Edoxaban 
      disposition in healthy and post-surgical patients was well-described with a 
      linear, two-compartment model. Creatinine clearance was significantly correlated 
      with edoxaban clearance and the rate of oral absorption was affected by surgery. 
      The probability of a post-operative VTE was significantly correlated with 
      steady-state metrics of edoxaban exposure estimated for each subject by Bayesian 
      post-hoc methods with age and gender being the significant and expected 
      covariates. The incidence of bleeding was low in these studies and hence no 
      exposure-response relationship could be identified. These analyses suggest that 
      edoxaban has a predictable anticoagulant effect in this patient population 
      leading to dose-proportional reduction in incidence of VTE with low incidence of 
      bleeding.

AB  - Edoxaban is mainly enzymatically converted to a 4-carboxylic acid form (4CA-EDX) 
      and an N-desmethyl form (ND-EDX) in humans. This study aimed to establish a 
      simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using core-shell 
      octadecyl silica (ODS) microparticles for the simultaneous quantitation of 
      edoxaban and its two major metabolites in human plasma. Analytes extracted from 
      plasma specimens by a one-step deproteinization were separated using a 2.6-µm 
      core-shell ODS microparticulate column and linear acetonitrile-ammonium acetate 
      gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min with a run time of 7 min. The mass 
      spectrometer was operated in the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode. 
      Plasma samples collected from 20 patients with atrial fibrillation were analyzed 
      by the present method. The chromatograms of drug-free human plasma had no 
      interfering peaks. The calibration curves of edoxaban, 4CA-EDX, and ND-EDX were 
      linear over the concentration ranges of 1.25-160, 0.47-60, and 0.12-15 ng/mL, 
      respectively. Their pretreatment recoveries and matrix factors were 88.7-109.0% 
      and 87.0-101.6%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and imprecision 
      values were 85.9-112.8% and within 13.3%, respectively. The plasma concentrations 
      of edoxaban, 4CA-EDX, and ND-EDX in the patients had ranges of 17.8-102, 
      1.67-25.7, and 0.685-5.34 ng/mL, respectively. All the analytes were measurable 
      within their calibration curves. In conclusion, this validated method for the 
      simultaneous determination of edoxaban and its major metabolites was successfully 
      applied to plasma specimens obtained from patients with atrial fibrillation.

AB  - To establish a rapid and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem 
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban in rat plasma. The analytes and the internal standard 
      (diazepam) were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 chromatography column 
      (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) using gradient elution with a mobile phase of 
      acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The 
      detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by 
      multiple reaction monitoring mode to monitor the precursor-to-product ion 
      transitions of m/z 436.1 → 145.1 for rivaroxaban, m/z 460.0 → 443.1 for apixaban, 
      m/z 548.2 → 366.1 for edoxaban and m/z 285.2 → 193.1 for diazepam (IS) using a 
      positive electrospray ionization interface. The method was validated over a 
      concentration range of 1.0-200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban, 1.0-100 ng/mL for apixaban 
      and 1.0-500 ng/mL for edoxaban. Total time for each chromatograph was 3.5 min. 
      The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control samples at 
      low, medium, and high concentration levels exhibited relative standard deviations 
      <10.5 % and the accuracy values ranged from -9.9 to 11.3 %. The method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban in rats.

AB  - Many patients under oral anticoagulation therapy need percutaneous or surgical 
      interventions/operations. For vitamin K antagonists (VKA), there are 
      recommendations regarding preoperative or postoperative administration. 
      Management of the new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) was supposed to be easier - but 
      some aspects must be considered. Due to the different pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      substances such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, different 
      recommendations are given.Upon periprocedural management, thromboembolic risk has 
      to be considered in patients treated with NOACs. NOACS have a pharmacokinetic 
      advantage in terms of a rapid onset and rapid elimination via the liver and 
      kidneys. Impaired renal function results in extended half-life of NOACs 
      considerably.Surgical procedures under NOACS can be scheduled at the beginning of 
      next dosing interval or omitted in low/minimal bleeding risk patients, so that 
      only 2-3 NOAC doses are not administered. In patients with moderate and high risk 
      of bleeding, there should be a NOAC break of 24-48 h prior to surgery in order to 
      allow a corresponding decay of the active metabolite. In patients with 
      low/intermediate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging is necessary if the 
      "unprotected" time (NOAC break) is less than 4-5-(7) days. In patients at high 
      risk of thromboembolism, individual consideration must be taken regarding 
      bridging or extended NOAC break. Whether NOACs can be dispensed or bridging is 
      necessary in these patients must be clarified in randomized trials for 
      periprocedural management of NOACs patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Edoxaban (the free base of DU-176b) is a new, oral direct Factor Xa 
      inhibitor. This is the first study to compare the hemostatic response to 
      edoxaban, ximelagatran, and dalteparin in healthy, elderly adults. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 40 adults (65-75 
      years), were randomised to: oral edoxaban (60 mg, twice-daily, 7 doses), 
      subcutaneous dalteparin (5000 IU, once-daily, 4 doses), oral ximelagatran (24 mg, 
      twice-daily, 7 doses) or no drug. Blood samples were taken before, and 1.5, 4, 
      12, 24, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, and 144 hours after, the first dose. The primary 
      outcomes were changes in thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment 1+2 
      and D-dimer, and adverse events. Additional biomarkers of coagulation, and 
      endothelial cell and platelet activation were compared (ANOVA). RESULTS: All 
      subjects completed the study. Inhibition of thrombin generation lag time, peak, 
      and constant velocity index were significantly greater, and extended for a longer 
      period of time, following edoxaban administration, compared with dalteparin. We 
      found that the traditional assay for anti-FXa activity was not appropriate for 
      the new anticoagulants. Biomarker changes following edoxaban administration 
      (including prolongation of prothrombin time) reflected inhibition of Factor Xa; 
      there was no effect on platelet, tissue factor or endothelial activation. There 
      were no clinically significant changes in primary outcomes. No serious adverse 
      events were reported. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of edoxaban resulted in 
      effective Factor Xa and TG inhibition, and was well-tolerated. Studies are needed 
      to confirm edoxaban (60 mg daily) use in clinical practice. SPONSORSHIP: Daiichi

TI  - An in vitro study to investigate the interference of enoxaparin on plasma levels 
      of direct oral factor Xa inhibitors measured by chromogenic assays.
PG  - 309-315
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12974 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Co-administration of enoxaparin and a direct oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor (xabans: apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) could give rise to the 
      problem of overlapping the anti-Xa activity when measuring direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) levels. We aimed to evaluate in vitro the degree of the 
      interference of increasing enoxaparin concentrations on xaban plasma levels 
      measured by different chromogenic anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators 
      and controls. METHODS: Seven plasma samples were spiked with apixaban, edoxaban, 
      or rivaroxaban at fixed concentration, and enoxaparin at increasing 
      concentrations (0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.50, 1.0, 1.50, and 2.0 IU/mL). The evaluated 
      chromogenic assays were as follows: Biophen DiXaI and Biophen Heparin LRT (Hyphen 
      BioMed), Berichrom Heparin and Innovance Heparin (Siemens), STA-Liquid Anti-Xa 
      (Stago Diagnostics), Technochrom anti-Xa (Technoclone), and HemosIL Liquid 
      Anti-Xa (Werfen). RESULTS: The presence of enoxaparin caused increased DOAC 
      levels, with over-estimation depending on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample. The smallest over-estimation was in the sample with 
      enoxaparin 0.125 IU/mL and the greatest in the sample with enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL 
      (0%, 3.1%, and 7.4% vs 583.8%, 526.1%, and 415.2% for apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, respectively). Biophen DiXaI showed lower interference compared to 
      other methods (maximum over-estimation in the presence of enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL: 
      56.4% dosing rivaroxaban by Biophen DIXaI vs 583.8% dosing apixaban by Berichrom 
      Heparin). CONCLUSION: The presence of enoxaparin interferes with xabans 
      measurement by chromogenic anti-Xa assays causing falsely elevated DOAC levels, 
      the over-estimation being dependent on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample.

AB  - Edoxaban is an oral once-daily factor Xa inhibitor with a predictable 
      anticoagulant effect. After oral administration, edoxaban is rapidly absorbed 
      from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching the peak plasma concentrations at 1-2 
      h. Oral bioavailability is 62% in healthy subjects and the terminal half-life is 
      approximately 10-14 h. Edoxaban has been extensively studied in three clinical 
      scenarios. In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, edoxaban was at least as effective as warfarin, 
      but with a marked lesser risk of bleeding. In the Hokusai-VTE study, edoxaban was 
      as effective as warfarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE) in patients with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both, but 
      with a lesser risk of bleeding. In the STARS program, edoxaban was more effective 
      for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip arthroplasty than low-dose 
      enoxaparin, without an increased bleeding risk. In this review, the available 
      clinical evidence about edoxaban is updated.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are among the most effective options to 
      prevent serious thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
      Coagulation assays are used to assess DOAC activity, but lack the possibility to 
      quantify drugs with concurrent pharmacodynamic effect. We developed a selective 
      multi-drug assay to analyze apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, edoxaban 
      M4, and rivaroxaban with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) in plasma fulfilling all requirements of 
      the FDA und EMA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. Plasma samples 
      were extracted using solid phase extraction in a 96-well micro volume format. 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters BEH Phenyl 1.7μm column 
      coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Extraction recoveries exceeded 80 %. 
      Concentrations of 1-1000 ng/ml can be precisely quantified (correlation 
      coefficient of >0.99) using 100 μL plasma volume. Intra-day and inter-day 
      accuracies ranged between 91.0 % and 116 %. Precisions at low and high 
      concentrations were below 13.3 %. The method was applied within a clinical drug 
      trial and eight short pharmacokinetic profiles of patients under DOAC therapy 
      were analyzed. The assay allows for highly sensitive and selective simultaneous 
      quantification of DOACs in patient plasma samples.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Uninterrupted Periprocedural Edoxaban in Patients 
      Undergoing Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation　- The Prospective KYU-RABLE 
      Study.
PG  - 2017-2024
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-19-0535 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The KYU-RABLE study, a prospective, multicenter, single-arm 
      interventional study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted oral 
      edoxaban in patients undergoing catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled patients with AF from 23 centers in Japan. 
      Edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg in patients indicated for dose adjustment) was administered 
      uninterrupted, once daily in the morning for ≥4 weeks before CA and 4 weeks ±7 
      days after CA with one dose delayed on the procedural day. The primary endpoint 
      was a composite of thromboembolism and major bleeding during 4 weeks from the 
      procedural day. Among the 513 eligible patients who underwent CA, 63.5% received 
      edoxaban 60 mg/day and 36.1% received 30 mg/day. For the primary endpoint, no 
      thromboembolism and 1 major bleeding event (0.2%, cardiac tamponade) were 
      observed. The plasma edoxaban concentration decreased depending on the time from 
      the last administration to the CA procedure. However, plasma levels of 
      coagulative biomarkers were within appropriate ranges regardless of the interval 
      from the last administration of edoxaban. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided 
      evidence of the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted edoxaban administered once 
      daily in the morning, with one dose delayed on procedural day, in patients with 
      AF undergoing CA. Edoxaban was associated with a low risk of periprocedural 
      thromboembolic and bleeding complications.

TI  - Evaluation of regional gastrointestinal absorption of edoxaban using the enterion 
      capsule.
PG  - 1286-92
LID - 10.1002/jcph.540 [doi]
AB  - Two studies in healthy subjects assessed the absorption of edoxaban when 
      delivered to specific locations within the gastrointestinal tract using Enterion 
      capsules. In study 1 (single-dose, 4-way crossover), 8 participants received 
      edoxaban 60 mg as immediate-release (IR) tablets (treatment A), as powder 
      formulation delivered to the distal small bowel (treatment B) or ascending colon 
      (treatment C), or as an aqueous suspension delivered to the ascending colon 
      (treatment D). In study 2 (single-dose, 2-way crossover), 10 participants 
      received edoxaban 30 mg as IR tablets (treatment E) or in granulate formulation 
      with fumaric acid 50 mg, added to acidify the local gastrointestinal tract and 
      enhance solubility, delivered to the ascending colon (treatment F). Peak and 
      total exposure following targeted drug delivery to the distal gastrointestinal 
      tract were significantly lower than with IR tablet delivery. In study 1, total 
      exposure ratios of treatments B, C, and D compared with A were 14.9%, 7.9%, and 
      6.1%, respectively. In study 2, relative total exposure was 12.6% for treatment F 
      despite the fumaric acid. Time to peak concentration was longer with higher 
      variability for edoxaban delivered to the distal gastrointestinal tract compared 
      with the IR tablet. These data indicate that edoxaban absorption occurs 
      predominantly in the proximal small intestine.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulant plasma levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated 
      with dexamethasone.
PG  - 346-351
LID - 10.1007/s11239-021-02561-w [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not recommended in COVID-19 patients 
      receiving dexamethasone because of potential drug-drug and drug-disease 
      interactions affecting anticoagulant concentration and activity. To evaluate 
      short- and long-term pharmacokinetic interactions, serial through and peak DOAC 
      plasma levels were prospectively measured during and after dexamethasone therapy, 
      as well as during the acute phase and after recovery from COVID-19 in 
      hospitalized, non-critically ill patients undergoing treatment with DOACs. 
      Thirty-three (18 males, mean age 79 years) consecutive patients received DOACs 
      (17 apixaban, 12 rivaroxaban, 4 edoxaban) for atrial fibrillation (n = 22), 
      venous thromboembolism (n = 10), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 1). 
      Twenty-six patients also received dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for 
      a median of 14 days. Trough DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within and below 
      expected reference ranges respectively in 87.5 and 8.3% of patients, with no 
      statistically significant differences at 48-72 h and 14-21 days after 
      dexamethasone discontinuation. Peak DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within 
      expected reference ranges in 58.3% of patients, and below ranges in 33.3%, of 
      whom over two thirds had low values also off dexamethasone. No significant 
      differences in DOAC levels were found during hospitalization and after resolution 
      of COVID-19. Overall, 28 patients were discharged alive, and none experienced 
      thrombotic or bleeding events. In this study, dexamethasone administration or 
      acute COVID-19 seemed not to affect DOAC levels in hospitalized, non-critically 
      ill COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Bioequivalence and Pharmacokinetic Study of 2 Edoxaban Tablets in Healthy Chinese 
      Subjects.
PG  - 1440-1446
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1156 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to investigate the bioequivalence of 2 orally administered edoxaban 
      60-mg tablets and the food effects on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban. 
      Sixty-four healthy Chinese subjects participated in this open-label, randomized, 
      2-sequence, 4-period, crossover study. All subjects randomly received 60-mg 
      generic (test) or branded (reference) edoxaban tablet in each period. Plasma 
      edoxaban concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry. The pharmacokinetic parameters maximum concentration (C(max) ) and 
      area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were compared to assess 
      bioequivalence. The geometric least-squares mean ratios for C(max) , AUC from 
      time 0 to the last measurable time point (AUC(0-t) ), and AUC from time 0 
      extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) were 97.0%, 95.4%, and 96.1%, respectively, 
      in the fasting test, and 98.6%, 100.0%, and 99.8%, respectively, in the fed test. 
      Food increased exposure and prolonged the time to maximum concentration of 
      edoxaban. Both formulations displayed comparable safety profiles, with no serious 
      adverse events reported. The 2 products of edoxaban tablets are bioequivalent and 
      safe in healthy Chinese volunteers. Food may have a modest effect on the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of edoxaban.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a microdosed cocktail of three direct oral anticoagulants in 
      children with congenital heart defects: study protocol for a single-centre 
      clinical trial (DOAC-Child).
LID - 10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001662 [doi]
LID - e001662
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are direct inhibitors of 
      coagulation factor Xa and are frequently used in adults for different indications 
      such as deep vein thrombosis or non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Paediatric 
      patients might benefit as well from DOACs because the simplicity and convenience 
      of their use is likely to decrease physical and psychological stress related to 
      invasive procedures associated with phenprocoumon and heparin therapy. Thus, it 
      is expected that the future use of DOACs will ultimately improve compliance and 
      overall safety of anticoagulant therapies in paediatric populations. To assure 
      safe and effective use the clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      these drugs need to be evaluated in children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is 
      a single-centre, open-label, clinical trial in a paediatric population with 
      non-cyanotic congenital heart defects. After having obtained informed consent 
      from the parents, each participant will receive a single oral administration of a 
      drinkable solution of a microdose cocktail of three FXa inhibitors consisting of 
      apixaban (12.5 µg), rivaroxaban (12.5 µg), edoxaban (50 µg), plus a microdose of 
      the two probe drugs midazolam (10 µg) and yohimbine (25 µg). Serial blood samples 
      (n=up to 20) will be collected at specified time points before and up to 25 hours 
      after cocktail administration. The primary PK endpoint will be the area under the 
      plasma concentration time curve of apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Secondary 
      PK outcomes will be C(max), t(max), t(1/2), Cl/F and V(ss)/F. Safety and 
      tolerability of the microdose cocktail will be evaluated as well by a collection

TI  - Insights into the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation: A Structured Narrative 
      Review.
PG  - 351-373
LID - 10.1007/s40262-023-01222-w [doi]
AB  - Older adults, the fastest growing population, represent almost 50% of all users 
      of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Unfortunately, we have very little 
      relevant pharmacological and clinical data on DOACs, especially in older adults 
      with geriatric profiles. This is highly relevant as pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) often differ substantially in this population. Hence, we 
      need to obtain a better understanding of the PK/PD of DOACs in older adults, to 
      ensure appropriate treatment. This review summarises the current insights into 
      PK/PD of DOACs in older adults. A search was undertaken up to October 2022 to 
      identify PK/PD studies of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, that 
      included older adults aged ≥ 75 years. This review identified 44 articles. Older 
      age alone did not influence exposure of edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, 
      while apixaban peak concentrations were 40% higher in older adults than in young 
      volunteers. Nevertheless, high interindividual variability in DOAC exposure in 
      older adults was noted, which can be explained by distinctive older patient 
      characteristics, such as kidney function, changes in body composition (especially 
      reduced muscle mass), and co-medication with P-gp inhibitors, which is in line 
      with the current dosing reduction criteria of apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban. Dabigatran had the largest interindividual variability among all 
      DOACs since its dose adjustment criterion is only age, and thus it is not a 
      preferable option. Additionally, DOAC exposure, which fell outside of on-therapy 
      ranges, was significantly related to stroke and bleeding events. No definite 
      thresholds linked to these outcomes in older adults have been established.

TI  - Effect of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor tamoxifen on edoxaban plasma levels in 
      women with breast cancer.

LID - 10.1016/j.thromres.2023.05.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concomitant use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors can reduce clearance of 
      edoxaban and increase its plasma concentration. Caution is advised with 
      simultaneous use of edoxaban and the frequently used P-glycoprotein inhibitor 
      tamoxifen. However, pharmacokinetic data are lacking. OBJECTIVES: This study 
      aimed to assess the effect of tamoxifen on edoxaban clearance. METHODS: This was 
      a prospective, self-controlled, pharmacokinetic study in breast cancer 
      participants starting tamoxifen. Edoxaban was given at a dose of 60 mg once daily 
      for 4 consecutive days, first without tamoxifen and later with concomitant 
      tamoxifen in steady-state. On day 4 of both edoxaban sequences, serial blood 
      samples were taken. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using 
      nonlinear mixed effects modelling in which the effect of tamoxifen on edoxaban 
      clearance was assessed. Additionally, mean area under the curves (AUC) were 
      estimated. Geometric least square means (GLM) ratios were calculated and no 
      interaction was concluded if the 90 % CI was within the 80-125 % no-effect 
      boundaries. RESULTS: Twenty-four women with breast cancer scheduled for tamoxifen 
      were included. The median age was 56 years (IQR 51-63). The average edoxaban 
      clearance was 32.0 L/h (95 % CI, 11.1-35.0 L/h). There was no effect of tamoxifen 
      on edoxaban clearance, with a fraction of 100 % (95 % CI 92-108) compared to 
      clearance without tamoxifen. The mean AUCs were 1923 ng*h/ml (SD 695) without 
      tamoxifen and 1947 ng*h/ml (SD 595) with tamoxifen (GLM-ratio 100.4; 90 % CI 
      98.6-102.2). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor 
      tamoxifen does not lead to reduced clearance of edoxaban in patients with breast 
      cancer.

      A Phase I Single-Dose Study.
PG  - 736-746
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3196 [doi]
AB  - This was an open-label, single-dose, phase I study to characterize the 
      pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics (PDs), and safety of edoxaban in 
      pediatric subjects from birth to 18 years at risk for venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE). Children requiring anticoagulant therapy were enrolled into 5 age cohorts 
      (0 to < 6 months (N = 12), 0.5 to < 2 years (N = 13), 2 to < 6 years (N = 13), 6 
      to < 12 years (N = 13), and 12 to < 18 years (N = 15)) receiving tablet or oral 
      suspension of edoxaban at doses expected to be equivalent to 30 or 60 mg once 
      daily (q.d.) in adult subjects with VTE. Sixty-six pediatric subjects were 
      enrolled and completed the study. Edoxaban plasma concentration peaked between 1 
      and 3 hours and declined rapidly until 4-8 hours. The range of mean total 
      apparent clearance across 5 age cohorts at low and high doses was 0.47 to 
      1.11 L/h/kg. The ranges of mean volume of central compartment and apparent 
      peripheral volume were 2.31 to 3.59 L/kg and 1.92 to 4.14 L/kg, respectively. 
      Across all age groups, the estimated median exposures were within the 0.5- to 
      1.5-fold of the median area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) 
      in adult subjects receiving corresponding doses (30 mg q.d. for low dose and 
      60 mg q.d. for high dose). In all age groups, PD parameters (prothrombin time, 
      activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti-Factor Xa activity) showed a 
      linear PK-PD relationship and were in line with previous adult data. The results 
      support further evaluation of the pediatric doses in larger pivotal trials.

      and duration of a 5-day oral ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) treatment on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three oral microdosed FXaI (rivaroxaban 25 µg, apixaban 
      25 µg, and edoxaban 50 µg) and microdosed probe drugs (midazolam 25 µg, yohimbine 
      50 µg, and omeprazole 100 µg) was evaluated in eight healthy volunteers. The 
      plasma concentrations of all drugs were quantified using validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods and pharmacokinetics 
      were analysed using non-compartmental analyses. RESULTS: Ritonavir increased the 
      exposure of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, but to a different extent the 
      observed area under the plasma concentration-time curve (geometric mean ratio 
      1.29, 1.46, and 1.87, respectively). A strong CYP3A4 inhibition (geometric mean 
      ratio > 10), a moderate CYP2C19 induction 2 days after ritonavir (0.64), and no 
      alteration of CYP2D6 were observed. A CYP3A4 recovery half-life of 2.3 days was 
      determined. CONCLUSION: This trial with three microdosed FXaI suggests that at 
      most the rivaroxaban dose should be reduced during short-term ritonavir, and only 
      in patients receiving high maintenance doses. Thorough time series analyses 
      demonstrated differential effects on three different drug-metabolising enzymes 
      over time with immediate profound inhibition of CYP3A4 and only slow recovery 
      after discontinuation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 
      2021-006643-39.

TI  - Novel Thiourea and Oxime Ether Isosteviol-Based Anticoagulants: MD Simulation and 
      ADMET Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/ph17020163 [doi]
LID - 163
AB  - Activated blood coagulation factor X (FXa) plays a critical initiation step of 
      the blood-coagulation pathway and is considered a desirable target for 
      anticoagulant drug development. It is reversibly inhibited by nonvitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, 
      and rivaroxaban. Thrombosis is extremely common and is one of the leading causes 
      of death in developed countries. In previous studies, novel thiourea and oxime 
      ether isosteviol derivatives as FXa inhibitors were designed through a 
      combination of QSAR studies and molecular docking. In the present contribution, 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for 100 ns to assess binding 
      structures previously predicted by docking and furnish additional information. 
      Moreover, three thiourea- and six oxime ether-designed isosteviol analogs were 
      then examined for their drug-like and ADMET properties. MD simulations 
      demonstrated that four out of the nine investigated isosteviol derivatives, i.e., 
      one thiourea and three oxime ether ISV analogs, form stable complexes with FXa. 
      These derivatives interact with FXa in a manner similar to Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs like edoxaban and betrixaban, indicating 
      their potential to inhibit factor Xa activity. One of these derivatives, E24, 
      displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties, positioning it as the most 
      promising drug candidate. This, along with the other three derivatives, can 
      undergo further chemical synthesis and bioassessment.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban 15 mg in Very Elderly Patients with Nonvalvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation: A Subanalysis of the ELDERCARE-AF Study.
PG  - 874-882
LID - 10.1055/s-0044-1785511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  We evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of low-dose (15 mg) edoxaban 
      in very elderly patients (≥80 years) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
      and high bleeding risk. METHODS:  This subanalysis of the phase 3, randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter ELDERCARE-AF study evaluated 
      edoxaban plasma concentrations and compared them with the Japanese population of 
      the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and Japanese severe renal impairment (SRI) studies. 
      RESULTS:  The PK analysis population included 451 patients, 53.8% of whom 
      concomitantly used antiplatelet drugs, 41.0% had SRI, and 38.0% had low body 
      weight. Edoxaban plasma concentrations at trough and 1 to 3 hours post-dose in 
      ELDERCARE-AF were 17.3 ± 13.9 (n = 427) and 93.3 ± 57.8 ng/mL (n = 447), 
      respectively. These values were slightly higher than the 15 mg group in ENGAGE 
      AF-TIMI 48 (n = 79; 12.4 ± 12.1 and n = 115; 78.7 ± 45.0 ng/mL, respectively), 
      lower than the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 high-dose reduced to 30 mg group (n = 83; 
      25.1 ± 36.6 and n = 111; 150 ± 91.6 ng/mL, respectively), but similar to the 
      Japanese SRI study (n = 39; 18.4 ± 11.2 and n = 40; 96.8 ± 48.3 ng/mL, 
      respectively). ELDERCARE-AF patients with SRI and low body weight (≤45 kg) had 
      higher concentrations than those without, and those taking antiplatelet drugs had 
      lower concentrations than those who were not. CONCLUSION:  PK data support 
      edoxaban 15 mg once daily for very elderly NVAF patients with high bleeding risk, 
      with caution for patients with SRI and/or low body weight.

TI  - Exposure Matching-Based Pediatric Dose Selection for Drugs with Renal Excretion - 
      Lessons Learned from Pediatric Development of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 1174-1187
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3396 [doi]
AB  - The pediatric clinical development programs of the direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have recently been completed, with 
      apixaban close to the finish line. One common pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristic 
      of these four DOACs is that renal excretion contributes 27% or more in their 
      elimination, resulting in age-dependent drug clearance in both pediatric and 
      adult subjects. Several lessons have been learned from adult exposure matching 
      and pediatric dose selection for DOACs. The main goal of this tutorial is to 
      provide an informed perspective on pediatric dose selection for renally excreted 
      drugs, using these four DOACs as case examples. This tutorial is organized into 
      seven steps: (1) consideration of age-related differences in disease and response 
      to treatment; (2) consideration of age-related differences in drug absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion; (3) selection of the reference adult 
      population and exposure for pediatric exposure matching; (4) prediction of 
      pediatric clearance and pediatric dose selection based on data from young adults; 
      (5) conduct and design of efficient pediatric PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies 
      that inform dose selection; (6) assessment of exposure matching and dose 
      adjustment using population PK simulation; (7) evaluation of the need for dose 
      adjustment in pediatric sub-populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated 
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of kinase inhibitors with warfarin and 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). METHODS: An in vitro CYP probe substrate 
      cocktail assay was used to study the inhibitory effects of fifteen kinase 
      inhibitors on CYP2C9, 3A, and 1A2. Then, DDI predictions were performed using 
      both mechanistic static and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. 
      RESULTS: Linsitinib, masitinib, regorafenib, tozasertib, trametinib, and 
      vatalanib were identified as competitive CYP2C9 inhibitors (K(i) = 1.4, 1.0, 1.1, 
      3.8, 0.5, and 0.1 μM, respectively). Masitinib and vatalanib were competitive 
      CYP3A inhibitors (K(i) = 1.3 and 0.2 μM), and vatalanib noncompetitively 
      inhibited CYP1A2 (K(i) = 2.0 μM). Moreover, linsitinib and tozasertib were CYP3A 
      time-dependent inhibitors (K(I) = 26.5 and 400.3 μM, k(inact) = 0.060 and 0.026 
      min(-1), respectively). Only linsitinib showed time-dependent inhibition of 
      CYP1A2 (K(I) = 13.9 μM, k(inact) = 0.018 min(-1)). Mechanistic static models 
      identified possible DDI risks for linsitinib and vatalanib with 
      (S)-/(R)-warfarin, and for masitinib with (S)-warfarin. PBPK simulations further 
      confirmed that vatalanib may increase (S)- and (R)-warfarin exposure by 4.37- and 
      1.80-fold, respectively, and that linsitinib may increase (R)-warfarin exposure 
      by 3.10-fold. Mechanistic static models predicted a smaller risk of DDIs between 
      kinase inhibitors and apixaban or rivaroxaban. The greatest AUC increases 
      (1.50-1.74) were predicted for erlotinib in combination with apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Linsitinib, masitinib, and vatalanib were predicted to have a 
      smaller effect on apixaban and rivaroxaban AUCs (AUCR 1.22-1.53). No kinase 
      inhibitor was predicted to increase edoxaban exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that several kinase inhibitors, including vatalanib and linsitinib, can 
      cause CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions with warfarin and, to a lesser extent, 
      with apixaban and rivaroxaban. The work provides mechanistic insights into the 
      risk of DDIs between kinase inhibitors and anticoagulants, which can be used to 
      avoid preventable DDIs in the clinic.
