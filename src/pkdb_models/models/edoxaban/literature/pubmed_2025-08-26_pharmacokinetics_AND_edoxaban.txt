AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have overtaken vitamin K 
      antagonists to become the most widely used method of anticoagulation for most 
      indications. Their stable and predictable pharmacokinetics combined with 
      relatively simple dosing, and the absence of routine monitoring has made them an 
      attractive proposition for healthcare providers. Despite the benefits of DOACs as 
      a class, important differences exist between individual DOAC drugs in respect of 
      their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with implications for dosing 
      and reversal in cases of major bleeding. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes 
      the state of knowledge relating to the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran (factor 
      IIa/thrombin inhibitor) and apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban (factor Xa) 
      inhibitors. We focus on pharmacokinetic differences between the drugs which may 
      have clinically significant implications. EXPERT OPINION: Patient-centered care 
      necessitates a careful consideration of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      differences between DOACs, and how these relate to individual patient 
      circumstances. Prescribers should be aware of the potential for pharmacokinetic 
      drug interactions with DOACs which may influence prescribing decisions in 
      patients with multiple comorbidities. In order to give an appropriate dose of 
      DOAC drugs, accurate estimation of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault 
      formula using actual body weight is necessary. An increasing body of evidence 
      supports the use of DOACs in patients who are obese, and this is becoming more 
      routine in clinical practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thromboembolic diseases will become the most important contributors 
      to mortality and morbidity for modern societies. Current antithrombotic 
      strategies using heparins or vitamin K antagonists are inconvenient, with 
      limitations and inherent side effects. A series of new oral anticoagulants with 
      powerful and reliable antithrombotic actions have been developed in the last 
      decade. AREAS COVERED: Edoxaban is a direct and specific inhibitor of activated 
      factor X, delivered orally. This article reviews literature from PubMed and 
      articles referenced within. The text explores the pharmacological aspects of its 
      antithrombotic action. Pharmacokinetics, metabolism and drug interactions are 
      examined. The review places the results of recent clinical trials that have 
      evaluated the antithrombotic potential of edoxaban versus standard antithrombotic 
      therapies in the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism into 
      perspective. The possible relationship between the pharmacokinetic profile of 
      edoxaban and the favorable results in clinical trials is discussed. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Edoxaban is perceived as a major advance, compared to vitamin K 
      antagonists, in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease given its 
      favorable efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic profile and renal clearance. The 
      results of ongoing large international trials exploring the prevention of 
      thrombotic complications in patients in different clinical settings should ensure 
      the approval of edoxaban to treat new indications.

LID - 10.1159/000535546 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are highly 
      prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Until recently, 
      warfarin was the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. Direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) have important advantages and have been shown to be 
      noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke prevention or recurrent VTE in the 
      general population, with lower bleeding rates. This review article will provide 
      available evidence on the use of DOACs in patients with CKD. SUMMARY: In post hoc 
      analyses of major randomized studies with DOACs for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation, in the subgroup of participants with moderate CKD, defined as a 
      creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30-50 mL/min, dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban were 
      associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism, whereas apixaban and 
      edoxaban were associated with lower bleeding and mortality rates, compared with 
      warfarin. In retrospective observational studies in patients with advanced CKD 
      (defined as a CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) and atrial fibrillation, DOACs had similar 
      efficacy with warfarin with numerically lower bleeding rates. All agents warrant 
      dose adjustment in moderate-to-severe CKD. In patients on maintenance dialysis, 
      the VALKYRIE trial, which was designed initially to study the effect of vitamin K 
      on vascular calcification progression, established superiority for rivaroxaban 
      compared with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in the extension phase. Two other 
      clinical trials using apixaban (AXADIA and RENAL-AF) in this population were 
      inconclusive due to recruitment challenges and low event rates. In post hoc 
      analyses of randomized studies with DOACs in patients with VTE, in the subgroup 
      of participants with moderate CKD at baseline, edoxaban was associated with lower 
      rates of recurrent VTE, whereas rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with 
      lower and higher bleeding rates, respectively, as compared to warfarin. KEY 
      MESSAGES: DOACs have revolutionized the management of atrial fibrillation and 
      VTE, and they should be preferred over warfarin in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe CKD with appropriate dose adjustment. Therapeutic drug 
      monitoring with a valid technique may be considered to guide clinical management 
      in individualized cases. Current evidence questions the need for oral 
      anticoagulation in patients on maintenance dialysis with atrial fibrillation as 
      both DOACs and VKAs are associated with high rates of major bleeding.

AB  - The most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants worldwide are the vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of 
      VKAs are important because deviations from their narrow therapeutic window can 
      result in bleedings due to over-anticoagulation or thrombosis because of 
      under-anticoagulation. In addition to pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., 
      augmented bleeding risk for concomitant use of NSAIDs), interactions with drugs, 
      foods, herbs, and over-the-counter medications may affect the risk/benefit ratio 
      of VKAs. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including Factor Xa inhibitors 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) are 
      poised to replace warfarin. Phase-3 studies and real-world evaluations have 
      established that the safety profile of DOACs is superior to those of VKAs. 
      However, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. 
      Herein we present a critical review of VKAs and DOACs with focus on their 
      potential for interactions with drugs, foods, herbs and over-the-counter 
      medications.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban, a Non-Vitamin K Antagonist 
      Oral Anticoagulant that Inhibits Clotting Factor Xa.
PG  - 641-55
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0342-7 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban, a once daily non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, is a direct, 
      selective, reversible inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa). In healthy subjects, single 
      oral doses of edoxaban result in peak plasma concentrations within 1.0-2.0 h of 
      administration, followed by a biphasic decline. Exposure is approximately dose 
      proportional for once daily doses of 15-150 mg. Edoxaban is predominantly 
      absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract, and oral bioavailability is 
      approximately 62 %. Food does not affect total exposure to edoxaban. The terminal 
      elimination half-life in healthy subjects ranges from 10 to 14 h, with minimal 
      accumulation upon repeat once daily dosing up to doses of 120 mg. The 
      steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 107 L, and total clearance 
      is approximately 22 L/h; renal clearance accounts for approximately 50 % of total 
      clearance, while metabolism and biliary secretion account for the remaining 50 %. 
      Intrinsic factors, such as age, sex and race, do not affect edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics after renal function is taken into account. Oral administration 
      of edoxaban results in rapid changes in anticoagulatory biomarkers, with peak 
      effects on anticoagulation markers (such as anti-FXa), the prothrombin time and 
      the activated partial thromboplastin time occurring within 1-2 h of dosing.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of edoxaban in Japanese adults 
      with atrial fibrillation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is used as an anti-coagulant to prevent cardioembolic 
      infarction, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics have been reported to be affected by several factors such as 
      renal function, age, body weight, and the concomitant use of P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitors. However, the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in drug 
      metabolizing enzymes and transporters and the inter-individual variability of 
      edoxaban pharmacokinetics in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains 
      unclear. Additionally, there is little information concerning PPK analysis using 
      real world data. In this study a population pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic 
      analysis was conducted to clarify covariate factors affecting the edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics in Japanese adult AF patients. METHODS: One hundred and 
      thirty-one blood samples were collected from 131 patients. The edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetic profile was described by a one-compartment model, and 
      pharmacogenomic data were stratified according to CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3) and ABCB1 
      (ABCB1 1236 C > T, 2677G > T/A, and 3435 C > T) polymorphisms. A non-linear 
      mixed-effects modeling software (NONMEM™) was used to evaluate the effects of 
      patient characteristics and genetic polymorphisms on the edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of edoxaban was 
      estimated, and the apparent volume of distribution was fixed at the reported 
      value. The CL/F of edoxaban was correlated non-linearly with creatinine clearance 
      (CLcr), wherein the population mean CL/F for a typical patient (CLcr = 61.8 
      mL/min) was estimated to be 28.2 L/h. Other clinical laboratory data and genetic 
      polymorphisms, excluding CLcr, did not affect the edoxaban pharmacokinetics. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1 
      are not considered intrinsic factors affecting edoxaban pharmacokinetics in 
      Japanese adult AF patients. Similarly to previous studies, renal function affects 
      its pharmacokinetics. These findings may provide useful information for 
      individualized anticoagulant therapy with edoxaban to prevent adverse events 
      without reference to genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1.

AB  - Edoxaban is an orally active inhibitor of activated factor X (FXa). Population 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses were performed to 
      characterize the PK and PK-PD relationships of edoxaban in pediatric patients to 
      identify the covariates that may contribute to inter-subject variability in PK 
      and PD of edoxaban in pediatric patients, and to compare the PK and PD data 
      between pediatric and adult patients. The pediatric PK of edoxaban was best 
      described by a two-compartment model with transit compartments, first-order oral 
      absorption, and linear elimination. The estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR), body weight, and post-menstrual age were the significant covariates 
      explaining variability in edoxaban PK among pediatric patients. A function based 
      on renal maturation was applied to edoxaban clearance. The clearance for a 70 kg 
      patient with an eGFR of 110 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was estimated to be 42.9 L/h 
      (CV ~ 31.8%). PK simulation showed that exposures across five pediatric age 
      groups were comparable to that in adult patients receiving 60 mg once daily dose. 
      The PK-PD relationship for anti-factor Xa was best fit with an E(max) 
      (8.65 IU/mL) model with an EC(50) of 631 ng/mL. The PK-PD relationships for 
      activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were best fit with 
      linear models (slopes of 0.0467, and 0.0415 s mL/ng, respectively). In addition, 
      due to the small number of efficacy and safety events, an exploratory analysis 
      did not detect a correlation between efficacy events (recurrent venous 
      thromboembolism) or safety events (clinically relevant bleeding) and edoxaban 
      exposure.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Edoxaban in Pediatric Subjects: 
      A Phase I Single-Dose Study.
PG  - 736-746
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3196 [doi]
AB  - This was an open-label, single-dose, phase I study to characterize the 
      pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics (PDs), and safety of edoxaban in 
      pediatric subjects from birth to 18 years at risk for venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE). Children requiring anticoagulant therapy were enrolled into 5 age cohorts 
      (0 to < 6 months (N = 12), 0.5 to < 2 years (N = 13), 2 to < 6 years (N = 13), 6 
      to < 12 years (N = 13), and 12 to < 18 years (N = 15)) receiving tablet or oral 
      suspension of edoxaban at doses expected to be equivalent to 30 or 60 mg once 
      daily (q.d.) in adult subjects with VTE. Sixty-six pediatric subjects were 
      enrolled and completed the study. Edoxaban plasma concentration peaked between 1 
      and 3 hours and declined rapidly until 4-8 hours. The range of mean total 
      apparent clearance across 5 age cohorts at low and high doses was 0.47 to 
      1.11 L/h/kg. The ranges of mean volume of central compartment and apparent 
      peripheral volume were 2.31 to 3.59 L/kg and 1.92 to 4.14 L/kg, respectively. 
      Across all age groups, the estimated median exposures were within the 0.5- to 
      1.5-fold of the median area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) 
      in adult subjects receiving corresponding doses (30 mg q.d. for low dose and 
      60 mg q.d. for high dose). In all age groups, PD parameters (prothrombin time, 
      activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti-Factor Xa activity) showed a 
      linear PK-PD relationship and were in line with previous adult data. The results 
      support further evaluation of the pediatric doses in larger pivotal trials.

TI  - Laboratory Monitoring of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs).
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9050445 [doi]
LID - 445
AB  - The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban, provides safe and effective 
      alternative to previous anticoagulant therapies. DOACs directly, selectively, and 
      reversibly inhibit factors IIa or Xa. The coagulation effect follows the plasma 
      concentration-time profile of the respective anticoagulant. The short half-life 
      of a DOAC constrains the daily oral intake. Because DOACs have predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses at a fixed dose, they do not 
      require monitoring. However in specific clinical situations and for particular 
      patient populations, testing may be helpful for patient management. The effect of 
      DOACs on the screening coagulation assays such as prothrombin time (PT), 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombin time (TT) is directly 
      linked to reagent composition, and clotting time can be different from reagent to 
      reagent, depending on the DOAC's reagent sensitivity. Liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered the gold standard method for DOAC 
      measurement, but it is time consuming and requires expensive equipment. The 
      general consensus for the assessment of a DOAC is clotting or chromogenic assays 
      using specific standard calibrators and controls. This review provides a short 
      summary of DOAC properties and an update on laboratory methods for measuring 
      DOACs.

TI  - Effect of Clarithromycin, a Strong CYP3A and P-glycoprotein Inhibitor, on the 
      Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban in Healthy Volunteers and the Evaluation of the Drug 
      Interaction with Other Oral Factor Xa Inhibitors by a Microdose Cocktail 
      Approach.
PG  - 747-756

AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed the differential effect of clarithromycin, a strong 
      inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of a regular dose of edoxaban and on a microdose cocktail of 
      factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). Concurrently, CYP3A activity was determined with a 
      midazolam microdose. METHODS: In an open-label fixed-sequence trial in 12 healthy 
      volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a microdosed FXaI cocktail (μ-FXaI; 25 μg 
      apixaban, 50 μg edoxaban, and 25 μg rivaroxaban) and of 60 mg edoxaban before and 
      during clarithromycin (2 x 500 mg/d) dosed to steady-state was evaluated. Plasma 
      concentrations of study drugs were quantified using validated ultra-performance 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. RESULTS: Therapeutic 
      clarithromycin doses increased the exposure of a therapeutic 60 mg dose of 
      edoxaban with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) of 1.53 (90 % CI: 1.37-1.70; p < 0.0001). 
      Clarithromycin also increased the GMR (90% CI) of the exposure of microdosed FXaI 
      apixaban to 1.38 (1.26-1.51), edoxaban to 2.03 (1.84-2.24), and rivaroxaban to 
      1.44 (1.27-1.63). AUC changes observed for the therapeutic edoxaban dose were 
      significantly smaller than those observed with the microdose (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin increases FXaI exposure. However, the magnitude of 
      this drug interaction is not expected to be clinically relevant. The edoxaban 
      microdose overestimates the extent of the drug interaction with the therapeutic 
      dose, whereas AUC ratios for apixaban and rivaroxaban were comparable to the 
      interaction with therapeutic doses as reported in the literature. TRIAL

TI  - Edoxaban population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analysis in patients 
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1339-51
LID - 10.1007/s00228-014-1736-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) and exposure-response relationship of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Concentration data from 1,134 subjects in 11 
      clinical studies (eight phase I, one phase II, and two phase III) were used to 
      perform a population PK analysis, including estimation of the bioavailability and 
      quantification of the effects of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors as well as 
      renal impairment on edoxaban PK. The potential relationship between edoxaban PK 
      exposure and incidence of bleeding events was explored based on data from 893 AF 
      patients. RESULTS: Absolute bioavailability of edoxaban was estimated as 58.3 %. 
      With oral dosing of edoxaban, co-administration of various P-gp inhibitors 
      significantly increased edoxaban bioavailability and decreased volume of 
      distribution (V 2), resulting in a predicted increase of 33-77 % in area under 
      the curve (AUC) and 65-104 % in C max. A much smaller increase was seen in 
      edoxaban concentration at 24 h post-dose (C 24, -24 to 38 %), due to decreased V 
      2 and shortened elimination half-life. With IV dosing of edoxaban, 
      co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor quinidine decreased both edoxaban 
      clearance (CL) and V 2, resulting in an increase of 32 % in AUC and 66 % in C 24. 
      Creatinine clearance was a significant covariate on renal clearance, whereas age 
      and body weight significantly affected nonrenal clearance. Model-predicted steady 
      state C min was slightly higher, but AUC was comparable for patients who had 
      severe renal impairment and received edoxaban 15 mg once daily (QD) versus 
      patients who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment and received 
      edoxaban 30 mg QD. Exposure-response analysis suggested that edoxaban C min and 
      country/region are significantly associated with the incidence of bleeds. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The model provided reasonable estimation with regard to the absolute 
      bioavailability of edoxaban, the magnitude of change in edoxaban exposure upon 
      co-administration of P-gp inhibitors, and the impact of renal impairment on 
      edoxaban clearance. Analysis results supported a 50 % dose reduction scheme for 
      subjects with severe renal impairment. Further confirmation will be sought by 
      incorporating clinical safety and efficacy information from larger phase III 
      trials.

TI  - The Clinical Significance of Drug-Food Interactions of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22168531 [doi]
LID - 8531
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the world. For 
      almost 60 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of 
      anticoagulation therapy, but in recent years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have become the anticoagulant treatment of choice. DOACs were initially 
      considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical 
      observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food 
      ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain 
      substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially 
      affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to 
      evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Patients treated with 
      anticoagulants should avoid products containing St. John's wort and take special 
      care with other food ingredients. As the interest in dietary supplements is on 
      the rise, healthcare providers can contribute to the development of well-designed 
      clinical trials on interactions between DOACs and food, and distribute sufficient 
      knowledge about the proper use of these supplements among patients.

TI  - Drug-Drug Interactions of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs): From 
      Pharmacological to Clinical Practice.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14061120 [doi]
LID - 1120
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
      edoxaban, are becoming the most commonly prescribed drugs for preventing ischemic 
      stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the 
      treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Rivaroxaban was also 
      recently approved for the treatment of patients with a recent acute coronary 
      syndrome (ACS). Their use demonstrated to have a favorable risk-benefit profile, 
      with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality 
      compared to warfarin, but with increased gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, 
      their safety profile is compromised in multimorbidity patients requiring 
      contemporary administration of several drugs. Comorbidity and polypharmacy have a 
      high prevalence in elderly patients, who are also more susceptible to bleeding 
      events. The combination of multiple treatments can cause relevant drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) by affecting the exposure or the pharmacological activities 
      of DOACs. Although important differences of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties 
      can be observed between DOACs, all of them are substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      and thus may interact with strong inducers or inhibitors of this drug 
      transporter. On the contrary, rivaroxaban and, to a lower extent, apixaban, are 
      also susceptible to drugs altering the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 
      activities. In the present review, we summarize the potential DDI of DOACs with 
      several classes of drugs that have been reported or have characteristics that may 
      predict clinically significant DDIs when administered together with DOACs. 
      Possible strategies, including dosage reduction, avoiding concomitant 
      administration, or different time of treatment, will be also discussed to reduce 
      the incidence of DDI with DOACs. Considering the available data from specific 
      clinical trials or registries analysis, the use of DOACs is associated with fewer 
      clinically relevant DDIs than warfarin, and their use represents an acceptable 
      clinical choice. Nevertheless, DDIs can be significant in certain patient 
      conditions so a careful evaluation should be made before prescribing a specific 
      DOAC.

AB  - Bariatric surgery may alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or 
      elimination (disposition) of orally administered drugs via changes to the 
      gastrointestinal tract anatomy, body weight, and adipose tissue composition. As 
      some patients who have undergone bariatric surgery will need therapeutic 
      anticoagulation for various indications, appropriate knowledge is needed 
      regarding anticoagulant drug disposition and resulting efficacy and safety in 
      this population. We review general considerations about oral drug disposition in 
      patients after bariatric surgery, as well as existing literature on oral 
      anticoagulation after bariatric surgery. Overall, available evidence on 
      therapeutic anticoagulation is very limited, and individual drug studies are 
      necessary to learn how to safely and effectively use the direct oral 
      anticoagulants. Given the sparsity of currently available data, it appears most 
      prudent to use warfarin with international normalized ratio monitoring, and not 
      direct oral anticoagulants, when full-dose anticoagulation is needed after 
      bariatric surgery.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and dose-exposure proportionality of edoxaban in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 743-52
LID - 10.1007/s40261-014-0229-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Edoxaban is a novel direct inhibitor of activated 
      factor Xa. A previous human pharmacokinetic study suggested a less than 
      proportional increase in edoxaban exposure at higher dose concentrations, but the 
      quantitative relationship, including the point of inflection, has not yet been 
      fully characterized. The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the 
      population pharmacokinetics and quantify the dose-exposure relationship of 
      edoxaban over a dose range of 10-180 mg. METHODS: Concentration data from 278 
      subjects in five phase I clinical studies were used to perform a population 
      pharmacokinetic analysis using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Model 
      performance was assessed by standard goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots, visual 
      predictive check, and bootstrapping procedures. RESULTS: Edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics were described by a two-compartment model, with first-order 
      absorption preceded by a lag time for absorption (t lag). Edoxaban relative 
      bioavailability (F 1) was estimated as 67.2 % and remained constant at the dose 
      range of 10-30 mg. For doses above 30 mg, every 30-mg dose increase was 
      associated with an approximately 6.7 % decrease in F 1. Sex was identified as a 
      significant covariate on clearance (CL), with female subjects showing 13.1 % 
      lower CL than male subjects. Food was found to affect t lag, but not F 1. When 
      compared with the fasted state, administration of edoxaban with food prolonged t 
      lag from 0.233 to 0.375 h. CONCLUSIONS: The population pharmacokinetic model 
      provided an adequate description of the observed data. The analysis results 
      suggested a less than proportional dose-exposure relationship for edoxaban at a 
      dose above 30 mg. A statistically significant sex effect on CL and food effect on 
      t lag were identified but are unlikely to be clinically important.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and its main metabolite in a dedicated 
      renal impairment study.
PG  - 1268-79
LID - 10.1002/jcph.541 [doi]
AB  - A model characterizing the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban and its 
      major metabolite, M4, following a single oral dose of 15 mg administered to 
      subjects with varying kidney function was developed. Thirty-two subjects 
      contributed with edoxaban plasma, edoxaban urine, and M4 plasma concentrations. 
      Edoxaban urine concentrations allowed estimation of renal clearance, and high 
      contribution of renal to total clearance enabled estimation of absolute oral 
      bioavailability. A 2-compartment model with delayed absorption and elimination 
      parameterized as renal clearance linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLcr ) 
      and nonrenal clearance forming M4 described edoxaban PK. The PK of M4 was 
      described with a 1-compartment model. For a typical subject (70 kg; CLcr , 
      100 mL/min) bioavailability, clearance, and central and peripheral volume of 
      distribution for edoxaban was estimated to 72.3%, 21.0 L/h, 95.4 L, and 54.3 L, 
      respectively. For both edoxaban and M4, the model predicted systemic exposure to 
      increase 57.0%, 35.0%, and 11.6% in a subject having CLcr of 30, 50, and 
      80 mL/min, respectively, compared with a subject having a CLcr of 100 mL/min. 
      Concentration ratios (M4 over edoxaban) were predicted to vary with time after 
      dose, but with minor influence of kidney function and body weight. Results were 
      in agreement with previous analyses.

AB  - Aspirin and P2Y(12) receptor antagonists are widely used across the spectrum of 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Gastrointestinal complications, 
      including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment 
      and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often 
      prescribed. However, potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been 
      suggested for PPIs, and, in recent years, it has been discussed whether these 
      drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, 
      clopidogrel. Indeed, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an 
      interaction through hepatic CYP2C19 between PPIs and clopidogrel, which could 
      translate into clinical inefficacy, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular 
      events. The FDA and the EMA sent a warning in 2010 discouraging the concomitant 
      use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In addition, whether the use 
      of PPIs may affect the clinical efficacy of the new P2Y(12) receptor antagonists, 
      ticagrelor and prasugrel, remains less known. According to current guidelines, 
      PPIs in combination with antiplatelet treatment are recommended in patients with 
      risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent 
      use of anticoagulants, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
      Helicobacter pylori infection. Like vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs can 
      determine gastrointestinal bleeding. Results from both randomized clinical trials 
      and observational studies suggest that high-dose dabigatran (150 mg bid), 
      rivaroxaban and high-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily) are associated with a higher 
      risk of GI bleeding as compared with apixaban and warfarin. In patients taking 
      oral anticoagulant with GI risk factor, PPI could be recommended, even if 
      usefulness of PPIs in these patients deserves further data. Helicobacter pylori 
      should always be searched, and treated, in patients with history of peptic ulcer 
      disease (with or without complication). Given the large number of patients 
      treated with antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet 
      inhibition or anticoagulant effect potentially carries a considerable clinical 
      impact. The present joint statement by ANMCO and AIGO summarizes the current 
      knowledge regarding the widespread use of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, 
      and PPIs in combination. Moreover, it outlines evidence supporting or opposing 
      drug interactions between these drugs and discusses consequent clinical 
      implications.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban

AB  - Steady-state plasma concentrations of anticoagulants and the time since the 
      previous administration in mainly outpatients with atrial fibrillation 
      administered standard or reduced doses were analyzed for 110 elderly Japanese 
      subjects (mean age, 76 years) treated with apixaban (2.5 or 5.0 mg twice daily), 
      dabigatran etexilate (110 or 150 mg twice daily), edoxaban (30 or 60 mg once 
      daily) or rivaroxaban (10 or 15 mg once daily) at one general hospital. The 
      pharmacokinetics in patients treated with standard and reduced doses of the four 
      anticoagulants using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was compared 
      with the concentration ranges estimated using physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic modeling. Reduced doses of anticoagulants resulted in relatively 
      small pharmacokinetic variations compared with the standard dose. Statistical 
      analyses revealed that renal impairment is likely not the sole determinant factor 
      for high plasma concentrations of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. 
      Patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with the correct doses of 
      oral anticoagulants as specified in the package inserts (e.g. reduced doses for 
      elderly patients, patients with low body weights and in combination with 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs) to avoid excessive or insufficient doses of 
      direct oral anticoagulants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition characterized by 
      forming a blood clot, or thrombus, in one of the deep veins, typically in the 
      legs. It is a type of venous thromboembolism, which refers to the formation of 
      blood clots in the veins. It is caused by Virchow's triad (stasis, 
      hypercoagulation, and endothelial injury). OBJECTIVE: Our main objective is to 
      explore the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban and edoxaban in treating 
      lower extremity DVT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving 406 
      patients subjected to DVT treatment using direct oral anticoagulants (edoxaban 
      and rivaroxaban) at our hospital. We recruited adult patients (aged 18 years and 
      more) diagnosed with lower extremity DVT and received treatment with either 
      rivaroxaban or edoxaban as the primary anticoagulant therapy for DVT. We excluded 
      patients who received treatment with other anticoagulant medications (warfarin 
      and heparin) as the primary therapy for DVT. RESULTS: The groups showed 
      statistically significant differences in red blood cell count and hemoglobin 
      levels, with the edoxaban group having high values. However, the 2 groups 
      observed no statistically significant differences in creatinine clearance, white 
      blood cell count, platelet count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels. The 
      difference in the incidence of pulmonary embolism between the 2 groups was 
      statistically significant (P value < 0.001). The edoxaban group had fewer 
      pulmonary embolism patients than the rivaroxaban group. The reduction in 
      recurrent thrombosis was significantly higher in the rivaroxaban group compared 
      to the edoxaban group. There were no significant differences in the major 
      bleeding at various sites across the 2 treatment groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rivaroxaban's pharmacokinetic profile includes rapid absorption and a relatively 
      short half-life. It means that once administered, rivaroxaban quickly reaches its 
      peak concentration in the blood and is subsequently eliminated from the body 
      within a relatively short period. Edoxaban's pharmacokinetic profile may include 
      slower absorption and a longer half-life than rivaroxaban. It can result in a 
      slower rate of achieving peak concentration and a more prolonged presence in the 
      bloodstream. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of 
      anticoagulant therapy in patients with underlying cancer and underscore the 
      importance of managing risks while providing adequate anticoagulation to prevent 
      thrombotic events.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of the Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral 
      Anticoagulant Edoxaban When Administered Alone or After Switching from 
      Rivaroxaban or Dabigatran Etexilate in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 127-36
LID - 10.1007/s40261-015-0357-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor. To support the possibility that patients may choose to switch 
      treatment from another nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant to edoxaban, 
      this clinical study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic effects of edoxaban after switching from rivaroxaban or 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban. METHODS: In this open-label, three-period, 
      crossover study, healthy subjects received 3 days of edoxaban 60 mg daily, 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily, followed by 
      edoxaban 60 mg on day 4. RESULTS: Day 4 edoxaban pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      similar for all treatments. The peak effect of edoxaban on prothrombin time (PT) 
      after 4 days of edoxaban only was 21.8 ± 2.46 s; after switching from rivaroxaban 
      to edoxaban, peak effect on PT was similar at 21.8 ± 2.88 s. After switching from 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban, least squares mean activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 2 h after administration was 47.6 vs 35.0 s for 
      edoxaban alone. The treatment difference was 12.8 s (95% confidence interval 
      10.5-15.1; p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis revealed that predose aPTT was elevated 
      on day 3 of dabigatran etexilate administration, and on day 4, indicating a 
      carryover effect from dabigatran. All treatments were well tolerated and there 
      were no safety concerns upon switching, with no increased risk of bleeding. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that switching to edoxaban from either 
      rivaroxaban or dabigatran etexilate at the time of the next dose is well 
      tolerated and maintains coagulation status.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of edoxaban in end-stage renal disease 
      subjects undergoing haemodialysis.
PG  - 719-27
LID - 10.1160/TH14-06-0547 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral, direct, once-daily, factor Xa inhibitor developed for stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and for the treatment and 
      secondary prevention of recurrent thromboembolism in patients with acute 
      symptomatic venous thromboembolism. Among elderly patients who require 
      anticoagulation therapies, some may have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This 
      open-label, phase 1, randomised, two-way crossover study was conducted to 
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in 10 subjects on haemodialysis. 
      Eligible subjects with ESRD on chronic haemodialysis received a single, oral dose 
      of edoxaban 15 mg 2 hours (h) prior to (on-dialysis) or in between (off-dialysis) 
      haemodialysis sessions. Haemodialysis resulted in a minor decrease in mean total 
      exposure (AUC0-∞; 676.2 ng·h/ml) as compared with that observed in subjects 
      off-dialysis (691.7 ng·h/ml). Mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) 
      values were comparable between on-dialysis and off-dialysis treatments (53.3 vs 
      56.3 ng/ml, respectively). Mean apparent total body clearance (CL/F) values were 
      24.1 and 22.5 l/h during the on-dialysis and off-dialysis treatment periods, 
      respectively. Dialyser clearance was 5.7 l/h and haemodialysis clearance was 6.1 
      l/h. Haemodialysis clearance was only 6.1 l/h, suggesting that it only accounts 
      for one-fourth of the total clearance in these subjects. A single, oral dose of 
      15 mg of edoxaban was well tolerated by subjects with ESRD. In conclusion, based 
      on these single-dose PK data, a supplementary dose of edoxaban may not be 
      required following a haemodialysis session. Importantly, haemodialysis is not an 
      effective mechanism for removal of edoxaban from the blood.

TI  - Edoxaban and the Issue of Drug-Drug Interactions: From Pharmacology to Clinical 
      Practice.
PG  - 1065-1083

AB  - Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is the latest of the non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Despite being marketed later than other 
      NOACs, its use is now spreading in current clinical practice, being indicated for 
      both thromboprophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
      and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In patients 
      with multiple conditions, the contemporary administration of several drugs can 
      cause relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which can affect drugs' 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Usually, all the NOACs are considered to 
      have significantly fewer DDIs than vitamin K antagonists; notwithstanding, this 
      is actually not true, all of them are affected by DDIs with drugs that can 
      influence the activity (induction or inhibition) of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
      cytochrome P450 3A4, both responsible for the disposition and metabolism of NOACs 
      to a different extent. In this review/expert opinion, we focused on an extensive 
      report of edoxaban DDIs. All the relevant drugs categories have been examined to 
      report on significant DDIs, discussing the impact on edoxaban pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics, and the evidence for dose adjustment. Our analysis found 
      that, despite a restrained number of interactions, some strong 
      inhibitors/inducers of P-gp and drug-metabolising enzymes can affect edoxaban 
      concentration, just as it happens with other NOACs, implying the need for a dose 
      adjustment. However, our analysis of edoxaban DDIs suggests that given the small 
      propensity for interactions of this agent, its use represents an acceptable 
      clinical decision. Still, DDIs can be significant in certain clinical situations 
      and a careful evaluation is always needed when prescribing NOACs.

AB  - The availability of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anti-coagulants alongside 
      vitamin K antagonists has offered a variety of options for anti-coagulation, but 
      has also necessitated a good understanding of the pharmacological properties of 
      each of these drugs prior to their use, to maximise the therapeutic benefit and 
      minimise patient harm Areas covered: This review article outlines the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the currently licensed VKAs and 
      NOACs that are most commonly used in clinical practice, with the aim of 
      demonstrating how variations in these characteristics influence their use in 
      clinical practice. A literature search was conducted on PubMed using keywords and 
      relevant articles published by the 31(st) of December 2018 were included. Expert 
      opinion: The effect of a drug is determined by a combination of elements which 
      include patient characteristics and external factors, in addition to its 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. A good understanding of these is 
      essential. Despite the wealth of information available, particularly on VKAs, our 
      knowledge on the pharmacology responsible for certain drug effects and 
      inter-individual variations is still limited. Increasing efforts are being made 
      to understand these and include focus on pharmacogenomics and drug transporter 
      proteins.

AB  - The oral anticoagulant edoxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, will likely be 
      coadministered with digoxin in some patients with atrial fibrillation. Both drugs 
      are substrates for P-glycoprotein. The objective of this phase 1, parallel study 
      was to assess the effects of coadministration of both drugs on their respective 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Forty-eight subjects, aged 18 to 
      45 years, received either edoxaban 60 mg once daily × 7 days (n = 24) or digoxin 
      0.25 mg twice daily × 2 days and once daily × 5 days (n = 24) and then 
      concomitantly for 7 days. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for 
      digoxin and edoxaban concentrations on days 7 and 14. Serial coagulation assays 
      were measured for edoxaban on days 7 and 14. Edoxaban PK parameters demonstrated 
      mild increases in area under the curve and peak concentrations of 9.5% and 15.6%, 
      respectively, when coadministered with digoxin. Although digoxin PK parameters 
      demonstrated increased area under the curve and peak concentrations of 8.3% and 
      28%, respectively, plasma concentrations were within the established therapeutic 
      range. Edoxaban PD were consistent with PK. Both drugs were well tolerated alone 
      or in combination. No clinically significant changes in PK, PD, or renal 
      elimination were observed with concomitant administration of edoxaban and 
      digoxin.

LID - 341
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clearance of edoxaban during modeled in vitro 
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), assess protein binding and circuit 
      adsorption, and provide initial dosing recommendations. METHODS: Edoxaban was 
      added to the CRRT circuit and serial pre-filter bovine blood samples were 
      collected along with post-filter blood and effluent samples. All experiments were 
      performed in duplicate using continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and 
      hemodialysis (CVVHD) modes, with varying filter types, flow rates, and point of 
      CVVH replacement fluid dilution. Concentrations of edoxaban and urea were 
      quantified via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for edoxaban were estimated via noncompartmental 
      analysis. Two and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were built to 
      assess the effects of mode, filter type, flow rate, and point of dilution on 
      CL(CRRT). Linear regression was utilized to provide dosing estimations across 
      CRRT effluent flow rates from 0.5 to 5 L/h. Optimal edoxaban doses were suggested 
      using CL(CRRT) and population non-renal clearance (CL(NR)) to estimate total 
      clearance and match the systemic AUC associated with efficacy in the treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Edoxaban clearance from the CRRT circuit 
      occurred primarily via hemofilter adsorption to the HF1400 and M150 filters at 
      74% and 65%, respectively, while mean percent protein binding was 41%. 
      Multivariate analyses confirmed the lack of influence of CRRT mode, filter type, 
      and point of dilution on the CL(CRRT) of edoxaban allowing dosing recommendations 
      to be made based on effluent flow rate. Edoxaban doses of 30-45 mg once daily 
      were estimated to achieve target the AUC threshold for flow rates from 0.5 to 
      5 L/h. CONCLUSION: For CRRT flow rates most employed in clinical practice, an 
      edoxaban dose of 45 mg once daily is predicted to achieve target systemic 
      exposure thresholds for venous thromboembolism treatment. The safety and efficacy 
      of this proposed dosing warrants further investigation in clinical studies.

TI  - Emerging anticoagulants.
PG  - 3388-416
AB  - Warfarin, heparin and their derivatives have been the traditional anticoagulants 
      used for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. While the modern 
      clinician is familiar with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these agents, 
      their adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development of newer 
      anticoagulants with improved safety, ease of administration, more predictable 
      pharmacodynamics and comparable efficacy. Research into haemostasis and the 
      coagulation cascade has made the development of these newer anticoagulants 
      possible. These drugs include the factor Xa inhibitors and IIa (thrombin) 
      inhibitors. Direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors are being developed with a 
      relative rapid onset of action and stable pharmacokinetic profiles negating the 
      need for close monitoring; this potentially makes them a more attractive option 
      than heparin or warfarin. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban. Examples of indirect 
      factor Xa inhibitors include fondaparinux, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux. 
      Direct thrombin inhibitors (factor IIa inhibitors) were developed with the 
      limitations of standard heparin and warfarin in mind. Examples include

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, biotransformation, and mass balance of edoxaban, a selective, 
      direct factor Xa inhibitor, in humans.
PG  - 2250-5
LID - 10.1124/dmd.112.046888 [doi]
AB  - This study determined the mass balance and pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in humans 
      after oral administration of [¹⁴C]edoxaban. After oral administration of 60 mg 
      (as active moiety) of [¹⁴C]edoxaban to six healthy male subjects, serial 
      blood/plasma and urinary and fecal samples were collected for up to 168 h 
      postdose. All samples were analyzed for total radioactivity by liquid 
      scintillation counting and for concentrations of edoxaban and four metabolites in 
      plasma, urine, and fecal samples by either high-performance liquid 
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method using multiple reaction modes, or 
      a liquid chromatography radiometric method. The mean recovery of radioactivity 
      was >97% of the administered radioactive dose, with 62.2% eliminated in feces and 
      35.4% in urine. Unchanged edoxaban accounted for the majority of radioactivity, 
      with 49.1 and 23.8% of the dose as parent observed in feces and urine, 
      respectively. Unchanged edoxaban was the most abundant species in plasma, with a 
      mean area under the curve (AUC)(0-∞) of 1596 ng · h/ml. The next most abundant 
      species was metabolite M4, with a mean AUC(0-∞) 147 ng · h/ml. The mass balance 
      of edoxaban was well described, with unchanged edoxaban as the most abundant 
      component of total radioactivity. Edoxaban is eliminated through multiple 
      pathways, but each accounts for only a small amount of overall elimination.

TI  - Effect of major gastrointestinal tract surgery on the absorption and efficacy of 
      direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
PG  - 343-351
LID - 10.1007/s11239-016-1465-x [doi]
AB  - Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced as alternatives to 
      warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism. Many patients undergoing major 
      gastrointestinal resections or bypass receive anticoagulants for various 
      indications, including the treatment of thrombotic complication of surgery and 
      prevention of visceral vessels events recurrence. DOACs have a wide therapeutic 
      range that allows fixed dosing determined based on studies conducted in healthy 
      subjects with normal absorptive capacity. Patients with significantly altered 
      gastrointestinal tracts were not included in the Phase II and III studies that 
      assessed DOAC efficacy and safety. The aim of this article is to review clinical 
      data on DOACs use in patients with major surgical resection or bypass. MEDLINE 
      and EMBASE were searched to identify studies and case reports of DOAC use in this 
      population. Prescribing information for the four approved DOACs was also 
      reviewed. The only types of available literature identified were case series and 
      isolated case reports. Patients who underwent major distal intestinal resection 
      were successfully anticoagulated with rivaroxaban, dabigatran was not effective. 
      There is uncertainty about the efficacy of rivaroxaban and dabigatran in patients 
      requiring anticoagulation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Avoidance of 
      rivaroxaban therapy in patients undergoing gastrectomy is advised Data are 
      lacking regarding anticoagulation using apixaban and edoxaban in patients with 
      major gastrointestinal resection or bypass is lacking. Clinicians should be aware 
      of these limitations when using DOACs in this group of patients.

TI  - Oral Anticoagulation Use in Individuals With Atrial Fibrillation and Chronic 
      Kidney Disease: A Review.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). It is associated with an increased risk of stroke, which increases 
      as kidney function declines. In the general population and in those with a 
      moderate degree of CKD (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min), the use of oral 
      anticoagulation to decrease the risk of stroke has been the standard of care 
      based on a favorable risk-benefit profile that had been established in seminal 
      randomized controlled trials. However, evidence regarding the use of oral 
      anticoagulants for stroke prevention is less clear in patients with severe CKD 
      (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) and those receiving maintenance dialysis, as 
      these individuals were excluded from such large randomized controlled trials. 
      Nevertheless, the direct oral anticoagulants have invariably usurped vitamin K 
      antagonists as the preferred choice for oral anticoagulation among patients with 
      AF across all strata of CKD based on their well-defined safety and efficacy and 
      multiple pharmacokinetic benefits (e.g., less drug-drug interactions). This 
      review summarizes the current literature on the role of oral anticoagulation in 
      the management of AF among patients with CKD and highlights current deficiencies 
      in the evidence base and how to overcome them.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in 
      Patients with Renal Failure.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1007/s13318-018-0501-y [doi]
AB  - A recent survey on the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) revealed that 
      43% of patients with atrial fibrillation and renal impairment were potentially 
      overdosed and had a hazard ratio for major bleeding of 2.19. In this review, we 
      analyse and discuss the effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of DOACs and of strategies proposed to adjust doses according to 
      the level of renal dysfunction. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of available 
      DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban) differ 
      substantially as regards oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding and the 
      relative involvement of renal and non-renal elimination. In this respect, 80% of 
      dabigatran is excreted as an unchanged drug in urine, whereas edoxaban, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and betrixiban are excreted unchanged by, respectively, 50, 
      33, 27 and 11% of the dose. Therefore, drug exposure (the area under the 
      concentration-time curve, AUC) is expected to increase to differing extents, 
      depending on the residual renal function and the contribution of the kidneys to 
      the excretion of each drug. Our analysis found that the increased AUC in patients 
      with severe renal dysfunction was greater than expected in the case of 
      dabigatran, betrixaban and rivaroxaban, indicating that other pharmacokinetic 
      parameters may be altered besides renal clearance. Although DAOC pharmacodynamics 
      do not seem to be altered by renal diseases (the correlation between plasma 
      levels and anticoagulant effects overlaps that of healthy subjects), renal 
      failure per se is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and 
      thromboembolism. Guidelines on dose adjustments in patients with renal 
      dysfunction have been published by three National Drug Agencies (FDA, EMA, HC), 
      but many of their items do not match one another, reflecting our substantial 
      paucity of knowledge in advanced renal failure. Routine monitoring of DOAC 
      anticoagulant effects or plasma concentrations is not recommended, since no 
      validated therapeutic ranges have been established. However, this approach may be 
      useful in emergency situations such as bleeding or thrombotic events, urgent 
      surgery, pharmacokinetic interactions, etc. We conclude that more experimental 
      work is needed to improve our knowledge of DOAC pharmacology in renal failure and 
      to provide clinicians with valid tools to adjust therapy.

AB  - Data on the impact of morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) on the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) of direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) are relatively limited, making it difficult to design optimal dosing 
      regimens in morbidly obese patients.To review literature on PK/PD profile, 
      efficacy, and safety of DOACs in venous thromboembolism (VTE) and nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with morbid obesity and make recommendations 
      regarding optimal dosing regimens in these patient populations.A detailed 
      literature search was conducted (from inception to June 22, 2022) for relevant 
      articles involving PK/PD and clinical data on DOACs use in morbidly obese 
      patients with VTE or AF, or healthy volunteers.A total of 28 studies were 
      identified. DOAC-specific PK variations and clinical outcomes have been observed. 
      Obesity may have a modest effect on PK/PD of dabigatran, apixaban, or 
      rivaroxaban. Dabigatran was effective in AF patients with morbid obesity but 
      might increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Standard dosing of apixaban 
      or rivaroxaban is effective and safe for VTE and AF patients with morbid obesity. 
      Trough edoxaban concentration and anti-Xa activity were similar in different BMI 
      groups (18.5 to >40 kg/m(2)), and standard dosing of edoxaban may be effective 
      and safe for AF patients.Current evidence suggests dabigatran should be used with 
      caution in patients with AF as it might increase the risk of gastrointestinal 
      bleeding; Standard dosing of apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used in VTE or AF 
      patients; Standard dosing of edoxaban may be considered in AF patients.

TI  - An Open-Label Crossover Study of the Pharmacokinetics of the 60-mg Edoxaban 
      Tablet Crushed and Administered Either by a Nasogastric Tube or in Apple Puree in 
      Healthy Adults.
PG  - 221-228

AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is an orally active, direct factor Xa inhibitor indicated to 
      reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. OBJECTIVES: This 
      study assessed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the edoxaban 
      60-mg tablet crushed and administered via a nasogastric tube in a water 
      suspension or orally mixed in apple puree. METHODS: This phase 1, open-label, 
      crossover study randomized 30 healthy adults to receive three edoxaban treatment 
      regimens (oral 60-mg edoxaban tablet, or 60-mg edoxaban tablet crushed and 
      administered via a nasogastric tube or orally in apple puree) in one of six 
      treatment sequences. RESULTS: Total edoxaban exposure was similar between the 
      intact and crushed tablet regimens (mean area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve from time zero to infinity: whole tablet, 2132 ng·h/mL; nasogastric tube, 
      2021 ng·h/mL; apple puree, 2076 ng·h/mL). Mean maximum plasma concentration, area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last 
      measurable concentration, terminal half-life, and apparent total body clearance 
      values were also similar. Time to maximum plasma concentration was significantly 
      shorter for the nasogastric tube suspension and apple puree vs. the whole tablet 
      [Hodges-Lehmann estimate of median difference (90% confidence interval): -0.75 
      (-1.25, -0.28); p = 0.0003 and -0.62 (-0.99, -0.26); p = 0.0024, respectively]. 
      The maximum plasma concentation, area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      from time zero to infinity, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration were similar 
      between treatment regimens; 90% confidence interval of the geometric 
      least-squares means ratios were within the predefined 80-125% bioequivalence 
      criterion. The safety and tolerability of edoxaban did not differ between 
      treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of edoxaban tablets 
      crushed and administered either via a nasogastric tube or orally mixed in apple 
      puree in patients who are unable to swallow solid oral dose formulations.

TI  - A single and multiple postprandial dose study investigating the pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban in healthy Chinese volunteers .
PG  - 256-263
LID - 10.5414/CP202737 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) 
      of once-daily postprandial doses of edoxaban 60 mg in healthy Chinese subjects. 
      METHODS: 6 male and 6 female healthy Chinese volunteers, aged 18 - 45 years, were 
      enrolled into this open-label, phase-I trial. Subjects received single oral doses 
      of edoxaban 60 mg after a meal, followed by successive once-daily doses for 
      7 days. Serial blood samples were taken pre- and postdose to measure plasma 
      concentrations of edoxaban and its major active metabolite D21-2393 as well as 
      prothrombin time (PT) and activated partialprothrombin time (aPTT). Safety was 
      assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Eoxaban was quickly absorbed after 
      dosing. The resultant maximum and total exposure of edoxaban after single 
      postprandial dose were similar to those after the same dose in fasting condition, 
      but t(max) was about half an hour longer. Meanwhile, the exposure of D21-2393 and 
      the metabolite-over-parent ratio were both lower vs. the fasting condition, 
      suggesting involvement of food on D21-2393 formation. Steady state was attained 
      after two successive daily doses. The PK parameters of edoxaban with multiple 
      postprandial doses were comparable to those observed in Caucasian and Japanese 
      volunteers. Similarly, the PD profiles and the concentration-response 
      relationship of edoxaban were not changed with repeated doses. Minor bleeding was 
      the most commonly reported adverse event during the study. CONCLUSION: Once daily 
      postprandial doses of edoxaban 60 mg was safe and well tolerated in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers. The PK and PD characteristics of edoxaban were comparable 
      among Chinese, Caucasian, and Japanese subjects. .

TI  - Edoxaban Exposure in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Estimated Creatinine 
      Clearance Exceeding 100 mL/min.
PG  - 666-674
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1050 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban 60 mg is approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) not fulfilling any dose-reduction criteria. As edoxaban is 
      partially renally cleared (≈50%), this study compared pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics of edoxaban 60 mg once daily with edoxaban 75 mg once daily in 
      patients with AF with high renal clearance (creatinine clearance > 100 mL/min) 
      over 12 months. Primary PK and pharmacodynamics end points were plasma edoxaban 
      exposure and anti-factor Xa (FXa) concentration. A population PK model estimated 
      edoxaban exposure at steady state. Efficacy and safety outcomes included 
      composites of stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, and major and 
      clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Of 607 patients, 303 and 304 were 
      randomized to edoxaban 60 and 75 mg, respectively. Edoxaban 75 mg provided ≈25% 
      higher exposure than 60 mg. This increase was accurately depicted in the 
      population PK model; anti-factor Xa concentration correlated with edoxaban 
      exposure. Rates of composite and individual outcomes were similarly low between 
      doses. In conclusion, the 25% increase in edoxaban dose (60-75 mg) resulted in 
      ≈25% exposure increase in the 75-mg group. Higher exposure was not associated 
      with reduced stroke risk in patients with AF with high renal clearance.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban 15 mg in Very Elderly Patients with Nonvalvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation: A Subanalysis of the ELDERCARE-AF Study.
PG  - 874-882
LID - 10.1055/s-0044-1785511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  We evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of low-dose (15 mg) edoxaban 
      in very elderly patients (≥80 years) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
      and high bleeding risk. METHODS:  This subanalysis of the phase 3, randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter ELDERCARE-AF study evaluated 
      edoxaban plasma concentrations and compared them with the Japanese population of 
      the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and Japanese severe renal impairment (SRI) studies. 
      RESULTS:  The PK analysis population included 451 patients, 53.8% of whom 
      concomitantly used antiplatelet drugs, 41.0% had SRI, and 38.0% had low body 
      weight. Edoxaban plasma concentrations at trough and 1 to 3 hours post-dose in 
      ELDERCARE-AF were 17.3 ± 13.9 (n = 427) and 93.3 ± 57.8 ng/mL (n = 447), 
      respectively. These values were slightly higher than the 15 mg group in ENGAGE 
      AF-TIMI 48 (n = 79; 12.4 ± 12.1 and n = 115; 78.7 ± 45.0 ng/mL, respectively), 
      lower than the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 high-dose reduced to 30 mg group (n = 83; 
      25.1 ± 36.6 and n = 111; 150 ± 91.6 ng/mL, respectively), but similar to the 
      Japanese SRI study (n = 39; 18.4 ± 11.2 and n = 40; 96.8 ± 48.3 ng/mL, 
      respectively). ELDERCARE-AF patients with SRI and low body weight (≤45 kg) had 
      higher concentrations than those without, and those taking antiplatelet drugs had 
      lower concentrations than those who were not. CONCLUSION:  PK data support 
      edoxaban 15 mg once daily for very elderly NVAF patients with high bleeding risk, 
      with caution for patients with SRI and/or low body weight.

TI  - Effects of concomitant use of prasugrel with edoxaban on bleeding time, 
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in healthy elderly Japanese 
      male subjects: a clinical pharmacology study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dual therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plus a P2Y(12) 
      receptor inhibitor is recommended in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Thus, we evaluated 
      the effects of DOAC edoxaban plus P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor prasugrel on 
      bleeding time (BT), and pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      edoxaban in healthy elderly Japanese male subjects. METHODS: A single-center, 
      clinical pharmacology study with randomized, open-label, repeated dosing enrolled 
      24 participants in two groups of 12 receiving 30 mg edoxaban once daily for 
      3 days; then 30 mg edoxaban plus 2.5 mg prasugrel (Group 1) or 30 mg edoxaban 
      plus 3.75 mg prasugrel (Group 2) once daily for 5 days. Primary endpoint was BT 
      by the Ivy method. Secondary endpoints were the PD parameters of prothrombin time 
      (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 
      (F1 + 2), and P2Y(12) reaction units (PRU), and PK profiles of edoxaban alone and 
      in combination with prasugrel. RESULTS: Geometric least squares mean of BT ratios 
      (vs. baseline) for 3-day edoxaban treatment were 1.097 (90% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.911-1.321) in Group 1 and 1.327 (90% CI 1.035-1.703) in Group 2; for 5-day 
      edoxaban plus 2.5 mg and 3.75 mg prasugrel, they were 1.581 (90% CI 1.197-2.087) 
      and 1.996 (90% CI 1.482-2.690), respectively. Contributions of prasugrel to the 
      effects (edoxaban + prasugrel/edoxaban) were 1.442 (90% CI 1.096-1.897) in Group 
      1 and 1.504 (90% CI 1.172-1.930) in Group 2. Edoxaban prolonged PT and aPTT and 
      decreased F1 + 2. Adding on prasugrel did not appreciably change PT, aPTT, or 
      F1 + 2. Prasugrel reduced PRU, whereas edoxaban had no effect on PRU. We recorded 
      26 adverse events; 23 were treatment-emergent (positive fecal occult blood test). 
      All participants with adverse events recovered during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coadministration of 2.5 mg and 3.75 mg prasugrel with 30 mg edoxaban prolonged BT 
      in healthy elderly Japanese male subjects. The effect was dependent on the dose 
      of prasugrel. Prasugrel did not affect PD or PK profiles of edoxaban. Edoxaban 
      had no effect on PD of prasugrel. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of Clinical 
      Trials No. jRCTs071190006; registration date, 26-April-2019.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety of Edoxaban for VTE Prophylaxis Post-Orthopedic Surgery: 
      A Systematic Review.
PG  - 230-238
LID - 10.1177/1074248416675732 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication that manifests 
      during and/or after hospitalization, as well as postsurgeries including 
      orthopedic surgeries. Edoxaban is a new oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has 
      been recently approved for treating VTE in patients who have already been treated 
      with a parenteral anticoagulant and for the prevention of stroke and non-central 
      nervous system systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate 
      the safety and efficacy of edoxaban for VTE prophylaxis after lower limb 
      orthopedic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted 
      in Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, and ScienceDirect to identify potential 
      records, then titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened using the inclusion 
      criteria to filter out irrelevant studies. Moreover, the data extraction and 
      quality assessment were undertaken using standardized tools, and the results were 
      narratively synthesized and presented in tables. RESULTS: Six studies were 
      included in this systematic review after screening 2989 records. The majority of 
      studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in VTE events in the 
      edoxaban group(s) compared to the dalteparin, placebo, or enoxaparin groups (P < 
      .05). The differences in VTE cases in some studies reached to approximately 50% 
      favoring edoxaban 30 mg over the comparator (P < .05). However, other studies 
      uncovered a statistically insignificant difference between edoxaban and the 
      comparator "enoxaparin" when used for VTE prophylaxis (P > .05). On the other 
      hand, although edoxaban found to cause more bleeding, the differences between 
      edoxaban and the comparator are statistically insignificant (P > .05). 
      CONCLUSION: This study helped to amalgamate evidence with regard to the use of 
      edoxaban for VTE prophylaxis post-lower limb orthopedic surgery. In line with the 
      results of the reviewed studies, edoxaban seems to be highly effective in 
      reducing VTE post-lower limb orthopedic surgery.

TI  - Effect of the frequently used antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, gabapentin, and 
      pregabalin on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and other oral factor xa 
      inhibitors in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1542063
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2025.1542063 [doi]
LID - 1542063
AB  - PURPOSE: Pregabalin, gabapentin, and carbamazepine, a potent inducer of 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, are frequently used antiepileptic 
      drugs that are often administered together with factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). We 
      aimed to investigate whether potentially clinically relevant drug-drug 
      interactions occur with these combinations. METHODS: In an open-label 
      fixed-sequence trial in 36 healthy volunteers, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics 
      of 60 mg edoxaban and of a microdosed FXaI cocktail (25 µg apixaban, 50 µg 
      edoxaban, and 25 µg rivaroxaban) before and during treatment with carbamazepine 
      (12 evaluable volunteers, individually dosed to therapeutic concentrations), 
      gabapentin (11 volunteers, titrated to 3 × 400 mg/d), and pregabalin (12 
      volunteers, titrated to 2 × 300 mg/d). The antiepileptics were dosed to 
      steady-state and the CYP3A activity was evaluated by assessing the 
      pharmacokinetics of microdosed midazolam (30 µg). RESULTS: Carbamazepine reduced 
      the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC∞ ) of 60 mg edoxaban by 
      a factor of 0.48 (geometric mean ratio (GMR) with 90% CI (0.41-0.56); p < 0.0001) 
      and C(max) by a factor of 0.47 (0.34-0.66) and reduced the exposure of the 
      edoxaban metabolite M-4 to a similar extent. Carbamazepine also decreased the 
      exposure ( AUC∞ ) of microdosed apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban by a factor 
      of 0.66, 0.59, and 0.56, respectively. Gabapentin and pregabalin did neither 
      affect the exposure of 60 mg edoxaban nor the exposure of any microdosed FXaI. 
      CONCLUSION: Carbamazepine decreased FXaI exposure to a clinically relevant extent 
      and dose adjustment may be required to maintain an adequate anticoagulant effect, 
      whereas gabapentin and pregabalin do not require dose adjustment of FXaI.

AB  - The aim was to investigate the bioequivalence of 2 orally administered edoxaban 
      60-mg tablets and the food effects on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban. 
      Sixty-four healthy Chinese subjects participated in this open-label, randomized, 
      2-sequence, 4-period, crossover study. All subjects randomly received 60-mg 
      generic (test) or branded (reference) edoxaban tablet in each period. Plasma 
      edoxaban concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry. The pharmacokinetic parameters maximum concentration (C(max) ) and 
      area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were compared to assess 
      bioequivalence. The geometric least-squares mean ratios for C(max) , AUC from 
      time 0 to the last measurable time point (AUC(0-t) ), and AUC from time 0 
      extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) were 97.0%, 95.4%, and 96.1%, respectively, 
      in the fasting test, and 98.6%, 100.0%, and 99.8%, respectively, in the fed test. 
      Food increased exposure and prolonged the time to maximum concentration of 
      edoxaban. Both formulations displayed comparable safety profiles, with no serious 
      adverse events reported. The 2 products of edoxaban tablets are bioequivalent and 
      safe in healthy Chinese volunteers. Food may have a modest effect on the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of edoxaban.

AB  - 1. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      single-dose edoxaban in healthy Chinese subjects. 2. This single-centre, 
      open-label, 3-occasion, cross-over study enrolled six males and six females. 
      Subjects received a single-oral-dose of edoxaban 30-90 mg in each study occasion 
      under fasting condition. Serial blood samples were collected to measure the 
      plasma concentrations of edoxaban and its major active metabolite D21-2393. 
      Meanwhile, PT, INR, aPTT were measured pre- and post-dose. Safety was assessed. 
      3. After administration, edoxaban was rapidly absorbed (median T(max )=( )1-2 h). 
      With rapid transformation, peak concentration of D21-2393 was reached within 2-h 
      post-dose. The elimination half-life of edoxaban was 5-20 h. The dose-exposure 
      relationships were slightly lower-than-dose-proportional for both edoxaban and 
      D21-2393. Although women had higher plasma exposure of edoxaban and D21-2393 than 
      men, it was considered clinically insignificant. 4. The effects of edoxaban on 
      all pharmacodynamic biomarkers were concentration-dependent and 
      linearly-correlated to plasma level of the compound. Minor bleeding was the most 
      commonly reported adverse events. 5. Single oral doses of edoxaban 30-90 mg were 
      safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese volunteers. 6. The pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles of edoxaban in Chinese subjects were comparable to those 
      observed in Caucasian and Japanese populations.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, 
      safety, and place in therapy of edoxaban for prevention of stroke in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and treatment of venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE) are reviewed. SUMMARY: Although warfarin has been an established therapy 
      for stroke prevention in AF and VTE, the need for agents with less monitoring 
      requirements, fewer food and drug interactions, and a lower risk of major 
      bleeding led to the development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Current 
      DOACs work by either directly blocking thrombin (dabigatran) or inhibiting factor 
      Xa (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Edoxaban is the newest DOAC and only 
      the second Food and Drug Administration-approved anticoagulant for once-daily 
      administration. Unlike apixaban and rivaroxaban, edoxaban does not interact with 
      the cytochrome P-450 system. The results of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and Hokusai-VTE 
      trials demonstrated edoxaban's noninferiority to warfarin. However, the 
      adverse-effect profile of edoxaban may limit the drug's use in clinical practice; 
      in clinical trials, patients with AF who had a creatinine clearance of ≥95 mL/min 
      had a higher rate of strokes with the use of edoxaban versus warfarin. 
      CONCLUSION: A review of the literature showed that edoxaban, the most recently 
      approved DOAC, is noninferior to warfarin for management of VTE (after parenteral 
      anticoagulant therapy) and for stroke risk reduction in many patients with 
      nonvalvular AF.

AB  - The new generation of target-specific oral anticoagulants is being prescribed for 
      increasing numbers of patients at risk of stroke or venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
      These drugs offer valuable benefits due to fast onset anticoagulation, a fixed 
      anticoagulation effect (allowing administration of specified doses), and no 
      requirement for routine monitoring. Edoxaban is a fast-acting oral anticoagulant, 
      approved for use in the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and in the treatment of acute VTE. Like many of the new oral 
      anticoagulants, it selectively inhibits factor Xa, in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. Multiple Phase II clinical trials have shown edoxaban to be noninferior 
      to vitamin K antagonists in the prevention of stroke and VTE, with a good safety 
      profile. To date, the pivotal studies to endorse edoxaban's clinical use have 
      been ENGAGE AF-TIMI and Hokusai-VTE, both of which have compared its efficacy to 
      standard warfarin treatment. This paper aims at reviewing the use of edoxaban in 
      the management of stroke and thromboembolic disease, highlighting the key study 
      results that have led to its current license.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence surrounding edoxaban use in patients weighing 
      <50 kg and >120 kg is lacking. The International Society of Thrombosis and 
      Haemostasis Scientific and Standardisation Committee suggests avoiding edoxaban 
      in patients >120 kg. Additionally, concerns exist regarding decreased efficacy in 
      patients prescribed edoxaban for atrial fibrillation with a creatinine clearance 
      (CrCl) >95 ml/min, a finding of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial when edoxaban was 
      compared to warfarin. OBJECTIVE: To derive a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) 
      model using clinical practice data, to understand the impact of bodyweight and 
      renal function on edoxaban pharmacokinetics. METHOD: Edoxaban plasma 
      concentrations and patient characteristics were collated from King's College 
      Hospital anticoagulation clinics between 11/2016 and 08/2022. A PopPK model was 
      developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling and used to simulate edoxaban 
      concentrations at the extremes of bodyweight and with varying renal function. 
      RESULTS: Data from 409 patients (46 < 50 kg, 34 > 120 kg and 123 with a 
      CrCl > 95 ml/min) provided 455 edoxaban plasma concentrations. A one-compartment 
      model with between-subject variability on clearance with a proportional error 
      model best described the data. The most significant covariates impacting on 
      edoxaban exposure were CrCl and bodyweight. Our work suggests that edoxaban 
      exposure in patients weighing up to 140 kg is comparable to those weighing 75 kg. 
      Edoxaban exposure is reduced in patients weighing <50 kg due to the recommended 
      dose reductions. There is also a reduction in AUCss when CrCl > 95 ml/min 
      compared to CrCl 80 ml/min. CONCLUSIONS: Our population PK model for edoxaban 
      suggests that renal function is a key driver for overall edoxaban exposure. 
      Further clinical outcome data is required to understand clinical effectiveness 
      and adverse outcomes.

TI  - Insights into the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation: A Structured Narrative 
      Review.
PG  - 351-373
LID - 10.1007/s40262-023-01222-w [doi]
AB  - Older adults, the fastest growing population, represent almost 50% of all users 
      of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Unfortunately, we have very little 
      relevant pharmacological and clinical data on DOACs, especially in older adults 
      with geriatric profiles. This is highly relevant as pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) often differ substantially in this population. Hence, we 
      need to obtain a better understanding of the PK/PD of DOACs in older adults, to 
      ensure appropriate treatment. This review summarises the current insights into 
      PK/PD of DOACs in older adults. A search was undertaken up to October 2022 to 
      identify PK/PD studies of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, that 
      included older adults aged ≥ 75 years. This review identified 44 articles. Older 
      age alone did not influence exposure of edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, 
      while apixaban peak concentrations were 40% higher in older adults than in young 
      volunteers. Nevertheless, high interindividual variability in DOAC exposure in 
      older adults was noted, which can be explained by distinctive older patient 
      characteristics, such as kidney function, changes in body composition (especially 
      reduced muscle mass), and co-medication with P-gp inhibitors, which is in line 
      with the current dosing reduction criteria of apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban. Dabigatran had the largest interindividual variability among all 
      DOACs since its dose adjustment criterion is only age, and thus it is not a 
      preferable option. Additionally, DOAC exposure, which fell outside of on-therapy 
      ranges, was significantly related to stroke and bleeding events. No definite 
      thresholds linked to these outcomes in older adults have been established.

AB  - Edoxaban, a once-daily, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for stroke 
      prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism 
      treatment. This study examined the effects of mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
      on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and its metabolite M4. Thirty-three subjects 
      enrolled in 4 treatment cohorts-mild hepatic impairment (n = 8), moderate hepatic 
      impairment (n = 9), and 2 cohorts of healthy controls matched for age, sex, and 
      weight (each n = 8)-and received a single 15-mg dose of edoxaban. Plasma 
      pharmacokinetics for edoxaban and M4, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT), and safety data were measured over 72 hours. Edoxaban 
      and M4 exposures were similar in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
      impairment compared with matched controls. Higher PT and aPTT values were 
      observed at baseline and after edoxaban dosing in the hepatic impairment groups 
      compared with healthy controls. Edoxaban 15 mg was well tolerated in all cohorts. 
      These results suggest that edoxaban exposure does not significantly increase in 
      patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, because of the 
      potential for underlying coagulopathy, edoxaban is not recommended for use in 
      patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. No dose reduction is 
      recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment.

AB  - Edoxaban is an oral once-daily factor Xa inhibitor with a predictable 
      anticoagulant effect. After oral administration, edoxaban is rapidly absorbed 
      from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching the peak plasma concentrations at 1-2 
      h. Oral bioavailability is 62% in healthy subjects and the terminal half-life is 
      approximately 10-14 h. Edoxaban has been extensively studied in three clinical 
      scenarios. In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, edoxaban was at least as effective as warfarin, 
      but with a marked lesser risk of bleeding. In the Hokusai-VTE study, edoxaban was 
      as effective as warfarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE) in patients with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both, but 
      with a lesser risk of bleeding. In the STARS program, edoxaban was more effective 
      for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip arthroplasty than low-dose 
      enoxaparin, without an increased bleeding risk. In this review, the available 
      clinical evidence about edoxaban is updated.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is very uncommon in children and adolescents 
      compared with older adults, though its incidence has significantly increased over 
      the past two decades. Given the rarity of the condition, the data on pediatric 
      VTE lag behind the adult experience and consequently the management of VTE in 
      children is, in large part, modeled on the adult strategies. This approach has 
      certain limitations, given that young children have developmental particularities 
      of the hemostatic system and differences in the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of various anticoagulant agents. The most commonly used 
      anticoagulants in children continue to be the heparins and the vitamin K 
      antagonists. Direct intravenous thrombin inhibitors, argatroban, bivalirudin, 
      have very limited pediatric use. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant 
      drugs (novel oral anticoagulants) present potential advantages in terms of 
      efficacy, safety, and convenience, though pediatric data are limited to 
      preclinical and small phase I trials. There are several ongoing phase I, II, and 
      III trials for dabigatran rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, the results of 
      which are likely to change the future management of pediatric thromboses.

TI  - The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in healthy adults.
PG  - 447-53
LID - 10.1007/s40261-015-0298-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The oral direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban is a 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate metabolized via carboxylesterase-1 and cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) 3A4/5. The effect of rifampin-induced induction of P-gp and CYP3A4/5 
      on transport and metabolism of edoxaban through the CYP3A4/5 pathway was 
      investigated in a single-dose edoxaban study. METHODS: This was a phase 1, 
      open-label, two-treatment, two-period, single-sequence drug interaction study in 
      healthy adults. All subjects received a single oral 60 mg edoxaban dose in period 
      1, and 7 days of 600 mg rifampin (2 × 300 mg capsules once daily) with a single 
      oral edoxaban 60 mg dose administered concomitantly on day 7 in period 2. A 6-day 
      washout period separated the treatments. Plasma concentrations of edoxaban and 
      its metabolites M4 and M6 were measured, and limited assessments of 
      pharmacodynamic markers of coagulation were performed. RESULTS: In total, 34 
      healthy subjects were enrolled; 32 completed the study. Coadministration of 
      rifampin with edoxaban decreased edoxaban exposure but increased active 
      metabolite exposure. Rifampin increased apparent oral clearance of edoxaban by 33 
      % and decreased its half-life by 50 %. Anticoagulant effects based on the 
      prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with 
      and without rifampin at early time points were maintained to a 
      greater-than-expected degree than with edoxaban exposure alone, presumably 
      because of an increased contribution from the active metabolites. Edoxaban was 
      well tolerated in this healthy adult population. CONCLUSIONS: Rifampin reduced 
      exposure to edoxaban while increasing exposure to its active metabolites M4 and 
      M6. PT and aPTT at early time points did not change appreciably; however, the 
      data should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - The effects of the antiplatelet agents, aspirin and naproxen, on pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics of the anticoagulant edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 212-21
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182970991 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, an elderly population that 
      frequently receives aspirin (ASA) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 
      concurrent illnesses. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of edoxaban 60 mg coadministered 
      with low-dose (100 mg) ASA, high-dose (325 mg) ASA, or naproxen (500 mg) in 
      healthy subjects (n = 126). Template bleeding times (BT) were measured. Mean 
      baseline (predose) BT for the 3 studies ranged from 4.72 to 6.13 minutes. 
      Edoxaban administered alone increased BT by 21%-35% (4 hours post dose) from 
      baseline. Concomitant administration of edoxaban with high-dose ASA, low-dose 
      ASA, or naproxen increased BT approximately 2-fold showing an additive effect 
      greater than either agent administered alone. Edoxaban pharmacokinetics were not 
      affected by concomitant low-dose ASA or naproxen, but high-dose ASA increased 
      systemic exposure of edoxaban by approximately 30%. The effects of edoxaban on 
      prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized 
      ratio, anti-FXa, and intrinsic FXa activity were not influenced by administration 
      with ASA or naproxen. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by high-dose ASA, 
      low-dose ASA, or naproxen was not affected by edoxaban. Concomitant 
      administration of edoxaban and ASA or naproxen was well tolerated.

AB  - This is a clinical safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) study of a single ascending dose (SAD) and a multiple 
      ascending dose (MAD) of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban in healthy 
      males. The placebo-controlled, single-blind, randomized, 2-part study consists of 
      a SAD arm with 85 subjects (10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 mg) and a MAD arm with 36 
      subjects (90 mg daily, 60 mg twice daily, 120 mg daily). Effects of food and 
      formulation (tablet vs solution) are assessed in a crossover substudy. In the 
      SAD, doses are well tolerated up to 150 mg. Exposure is proportional to dose. PK 
      profiles are consistent across dose with rapid absorption, biphasic elimination, 
      and terminal elimination half-life of 5.8 to 10.7 hours. In the MAD, mean 
      accumulation after daily dosing is 1.10 to 1.13 and consistent with elimination 
      half-life of 8.75 to 10.4 hours. Intrasubject variability ranges from 12% to 17% 
      for area under the curve. In general, plasma edoxaban concentrations are linearly 
      correlated with coagulation parameters. Edoxaban is safe and well tolerated with 
      no dose-dependent increases in adverse events. It is concluded that single and 
      multiple doses of edoxaban are safe and well tolerated up to 150 mg with 
      predictable PK and PD profiles.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in patients with symptomatic deep-vein 
      thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism--the Hokusai-VTE phase 3 study.
PG  - 1374-87
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12727 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study characterized the population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in 
      patients with symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in the 
      Hokusai-VTE phase 3 study. The impact of the protocol-specified 50% dose 
      reductions applied to patients with body weight ≤ 60 kg, creatinine clearance 
      (CL(cr)) of 30 to 50 ml min(-1) or concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitor on 
      edoxaban exposure was assessed using simulations. METHODS: The sparse data from 
      Hokusai-VTE, 9531 concentrations collected from 3707 patients, were pooled with 
      data from 13 phase 1 studies. In the analysis, the covariate relationships used 
      for dose reductions were estimated and differences between healthy subjects and 
      patients as well as additional covariate effects of age, race and gender were 
      explored based on statistical and clinical significance. RESULTS: A linear 
      two-compartment model with first order absorption preceded by a lag time best 
      described the data. Allometrically scaled body weight was included on disposition 
      parameters. Apparent clearance was parameterized as non-renal and renal. The 
      latter increased non-linearly with increasing CL(cr). Compared with healthy 
      volunteers, inter-compartmental clearance and the CL(cr) covariate effect were 
      different in patients (+64.6% and +274%). Asian patients had a 22.6% increased 
      apparent central volume of distribution. The effect of co-administration of 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitors seen in phase 1 could not be confirmed in the phase 3 
      data. Model-based simulations revealed lower exposure in dose-reduced compared 
      with non-dose-reduced patients. CONCLUSIONS: The adopted dose-reduction strategy 
      resulted in reduced exposure compared with non-dose-reduced, thereby 
      overcompensating for covariate effects. The clinical impact of these differences 
      on safety and efficacy remains to be evaluated.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacology and Role of Edoxaban in Contemporary Antithrombotic 
      Therapy.
PG  - 98-104
AB  - Edoxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that is approved for prevention of stroke in 
      individuals with atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous thromboembolic 
      disease at once daily 60 mg dose for individuals with normal renal function. A 
      decrease of dose to 30 mg is recommended for those with moderate renal 
      insufficiency, weight ≤ 60 kg or simultaneous administration of strong 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitors. At this time, it is not recommended for use in persons 
      with either end stage renal disease or with GFR exceeding 95 mL/min. Shorter 
      half-life averaging 8-10 hours may translate into a safer profile. With a fast 
      onset of action of ~1.5 hours and relatively high bioavailability, edoxaban is an 
      alternative for patients who may not be good candidates for warfarin therapy due 
      to multiple limitations that vitamin K anticoagulation entails. No clear benefits 
      of edoxaban have been reported to date compared to the other available factor Xa 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Responsible, Safe, and Effective Use of Antithrombotics and Anticoagulants in 
      Patients Undergoing Interventional Techniques: American Society of Interventional 
      Pain Physicians (ASIPP) Guidelines.
PG  - S75-S128
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventional pain management involves diagnosis and treatment of 
      chronic pain. This specialty utilizes minimally invasive procedures to target 
      therapeutics to the central nervous system and the spinal column. A subset of 
      patients encountered in interventional pain are medicated using anticoagulant or 
      antithrombotic drugs to mitigate thrombosis risk. Since these drugs target the 
      clotting system, bleeding risk is a consideration accompanying interventional 
      procedures. Importantly, discontinuation of anticoagulant or antithrombotic drugs 
      exposes underlying thrombosis risk, which can lead to significant morbidity and 
      mortality especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. 
      This review summarizes the literature and provides guidelines based on best 
      evidence for patients receiving anti-clotting therapy during interventional pain 
      procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Best evidence synthesis. OBJECTIVE: To provide a 
      current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding an assessment of the 
      bleeding risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant 
      and/or antithrombotic medications. METHODS: A review of the available literature 
      published on bleeding risk during interventional pain procedures, practice 
      patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy 
      was conducted. Data sources included relevant literature identified through 
      searches of EMBASE and PubMed from 1966 through August 2018 and manual searches 
      of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. RESULTS: 1. There is 
      good evidence for risk stratification by categorizing multiple interventional 
      techniques into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk. Also, their risk should 
      be upgraded based on other risk factors.2. There is good evidence for the risk of 
      thromboembolic events in patients who interrupt antithrombotic therapy. 3. There 
      is good evidence supporting discontinuation of low dose aspirin for high risk and 
      moderate risk procedures for at least 3 days, and there is moderate evidence that 
      these may be continued for low risk or some intermediate risk procedures.4. There 
      is good evidence that discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, 
      heparin, dabigatran (Pradaxa®), argatroban (Acova®), bivalirudin (Angiomax®), 
      lepirudin (Refludan®), desirudin (Iprivask®), hirudin, apixaban (Eliquis®), 
      rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), edoxaban (Savaysa®, Lixiana®), Betrixaban(Bevyxxa®), 
      fondaparinux (Arixtra®) prior to interventional techniques with individual 
      consideration of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs and 
      individual risk factors increases safety.5. There is good evidence that diagnosis 
      of epidural hematoma is based on severe pain at the site of the injection, rapid 
      neurological deterioration, and MRI with surgical decompression with progressive 
      neurological dysfunction to avoid neurological sequelae.6. There is good evidence 
      that if thromboembolic risk is high, low molecular weight heparin bridge therapy 
      can be instituted during cessation of the anticoagulant, and the low molecular 
      weight heparin can be discontinued 24 hours before the pain procedure.7. There is 
      fair evidence that the risk of thromboembolic events is higher than that of 
      epidural hematoma formation with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy 
      preceding interventional techniques, though both risks are significant.8. There 
      is fair evidence that multiple variables including anatomic pathology with spinal 
      stenosis and ankylosing spondylitis; high risk procedures and moderate risk 
      procedures combined with anatomic risk factors; bleeding observed during the 
      procedure, and multiple attempts during the procedures increase the risk for 
      bleeding complications and epidural hematoma.9. There is fair evidence that 
      discontinuation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors is optional (dipyridamole 
      [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal]. However, there is also fair evidence to 
      discontinue Aggrenox [dipyridamole plus aspirin]) 3 days prior to undergoing 
      interventional techniques of moderate and high risk. 10. There is fair evidence 
      to make shared decision making between the patient and the treating physicians 
      with the treating physician and to consider all the appropriate risks associated 
      with continuation or discontinuation of antithrombotic or anticoagulant 
      therapy.11. There is fair evidence that if thromboembolic risk is high 
      antithrombotic therapy may be resumed 12 hours after the interventional procedure 
      is performed.12. There is limited evidence that discontinuation of antiplatelet 
      therapy (clopidogrel [Plavix®], ticlopidine [Ticlid®], Ticagrelor [Brilinta®] and 
      prasugrel [Effient®]) avoids complications of significant bleeding and epidural 
      hematomas.13. There is very limited evidence supporting the continuation or 
      discontinuation of most NSAIDs, excluding aspirin, for 1 to 2 days and some 4 to 
      10 days, since these are utilized for pain management without cardiac or cerebral 
      protective effect. LIMITATIONS: The continued paucity of the literature with 
      discordant recommendations. CONCLUSION: Based on the survey of current 
      literature, and published clinical guidelines, recommendations for patients 
      presenting with ongoing antithrombotic therapy prior to interventional techniques 
      are variable, and are based on comprehensive analysis of each patient and the 
      risk-benefit analysis of intervention. KEY WORDS: Perioperative bleeding, 
      bleeding risk, practice patterns, anticoagulant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, 
      interventional techniques, safety precautions, pain.

TI  - Edoxaban drug-drug interactions with ketoconazole, erythromycin, and 
      cyclosporine.
PG  - 1591-1600
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13092 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Edoxaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 
      3 A4 (CYP3A4) and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Three edoxaban 
      drug-drug interaction studies examined the effects of P-gp inhibitors with 
      varying degrees of CYP3A4 inhibition. METHODS: In each study, healthy subjects 
      received a single oral dose of 60 mg edoxaban with or without an oral dual 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor as follows: ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days, 
      edoxaban on day 4; erythromycin 500 mg four times daily for 8 days, edoxaban on 
      day 7; or single dose of cyclosporine 500 mg with edoxaban. Serial plasma samples 
      were obtained for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Safety was assessed 
      throughout the study. RESULTS: Coadministration of ketoconazole, erythromycin, or 
      cyclosporine increased edoxaban total exposure by 87%, 85%, and 73%, 
      respectively, and the peak concentration by 89%, 68%, and 74%, respectively, 
      compared with edoxaban alone. The half-life did not change appreciably. Exposure 
      of M4, the major active edoxaban metabolite, was consistent when edoxaban was 
      administered alone or with ketoconazole and erythromycin. With cyclosporine, M4 
      total exposure increased by 6.9-fold and peak exposure by 8.7-fold, suggesting an 
      additional interaction. Pharmacodynamic effects were reflective of increased 
      edoxaban exposure. No clinically significant adverse events were observed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Administration of dual inhibitors of P-gp and CYP3A4 increased 
      edoxaban exposure by less than two-fold. This effect appears to be primarily due 
      to inhibition of P-gp. The impact of CYP3A4 inhibition appears to be less 
      pronounced, and its contribution to total clearance appears limited in healthy 
      subjects.

TI  - TAVR: nemesis of NOACs?
PG  - 181-184
LID - 10.1007/s11239-022-02721-6 [doi]
AB  - Data on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in transcatheter 
      aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients are controversial. In patients without 
      atrial fibrillation (AF), rivaroxaban showed enhanced ischemia and bleeding as 
      compared to standard of care. ENVISAGE showed enhanced bleeding in AF patients as 
      compared to vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Only apixaban was non-inferior but failed 
      superiority regarding bleeding in AF patients after TAVR. One could hypothesize 
      that this might be due to pharmacokinetics of NOACs. Therefore, we compared 
      outcome in rivaroxaban/edoxaban (once-daily) and apixaban (twice-daily) treated 
      patients. 568 patients with indication for permanent oral anticoagulation due to 
      AF undergoing TAVR were analyzed via inverse probability of treatment weighting. 
      Valve academic research consortium complications during 30-day follow-up were 
      assessed. Bleeding complications were similar in once-daily and twice-daily NOACs 
      (major: 22 (7.5%) vs. 14 (5.3%), p = 0.285; minor: 66 (22.4%) vs. 46 (17.4%), 
      p = 0.133). Complications did not change when splitting the cohort in the 
      different agents apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. These findings remained 
      robust after multivariate analysis. In summary, twice-daily and once-daily NOACs 
      did not differ regarding bleeding complications in a hypothesis generating 
      real-world cohort of TAVR patients with AF.

AB  - Historically, vitamin K antagonists have been the only class of oral 
      anticoagulants available. Despite our experience with warfarin over the past 
      60 years, its use is associated with several pharmacokinetic and clinical 
      disadvantages including unpredictable dosing, frequent monitoring, and delayed 
      onset and offset. Edoxaban, an oral direct Xa inhibitor, may provide clinicians 
      with an additional option in patients requiring chronic anticoagulation. This 
      review examines the pharmacology and clinical data of edoxaban as a therapeutic 
      alternative.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
      of edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, in healthy subjects switching 
      from warfarin. METHODS: Seventy-two subjects were randomized to edoxaban 60 mg 
      once daily (n = 48) or matching placebo (n = 24) for 5 days at 24 h after the 
      last dose of warfarin treatment (INR 2.0 to 3.0). Safety/tolerability was the 
      primary outcome measure. Pharmacokinetics, INR, aPTT, anti-FXa, thrombin 
      generation and other coagulation assays were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-two 
      subjects were randomized and 64 subjects received at least one dose of edoxaban 
      (n = 43) or placebo (n = 21) after achieving a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 on 
      warfarin treatment. Edoxaban 60 mg administered 24 h post-warfarin appeared to be 
      safe and well tolerated. Adverse events were similar across treatments. For 
      bleeding-related adverse events, eight subjects tested positive for faecal occult 
      blood, five subjects during warfarin treatment and three subjects during edoxaban 
      treatment. The mean (SD) baseline (post-dose of warfarin) INR was 2.31 (0.193) 
      which increased to 3.84 (0.744) over 2 h during the edoxaban treatment (P < 
      0.0001 vs. placebo), returning to post-warfarin baseline within 12 h. A similar 
      time course of effects for the other coagulation assays was observed in 
      accordance with the drugs' mechanisms of action. CONCLUSION: In this study of 
      healthy subjects, edoxaban administered 24 h after the last dose of warfarin was 
      safe and well tolerated with transient increases across the various coagulation 
      assays above post-warfarin baseline levels.

TI  - Plasma Concentration and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban in Patients with 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Heart Failure.
PG  - 1061-1071
LID - 10.1007/s40262-021-00999-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles and safety of edoxaban in patients with nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who were hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF). 
      METHODS: The trough plasma concentrations of edoxaban, and the coagulation 
      biomarkers prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1+2) and D-dimer, were determined. 
      Twenty-six patients received edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg when dose adjustment was 
      required) and blood samples were collected immediately before oral edoxaban 
      administration for 7 consecutive days after hospitalization and on the day of 
      discharge. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 13 (range 7-46) days. Trough 
      plasma concentrations of edoxaban were constant from day 2 onwards. On day 1, the 
      variation was greater owing to the differing intervals between the last edoxaban 
      dose and day 1 blood collection. Trough plasma concentrations were higher in 
      patients with reduced creatinine clearance (≤ 50 mL/min). Median values for F1+2 
      and D-dimer remained within normal ranges throughout the study. There were no 
      drug discontinuations, and no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This is the first study of edoxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in 
      patients with NVAF and AHF, and shows that the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles of edoxaban were constant during hospitalization. Thus, 
      even in patients with NVAF and AHF, edoxaban anticoagulation therapy with guided 
      dose adjustment is considered to be a safe and appropriate intervention. In 
      particular, patients with reduced creatinine clearance should adhere to dose 
      adjustment criteria. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: jRCTs031190006 (Japan Registry 
      of Clinical Trials), 5 April, 2019 retrospectively registered.

AB  - Since SLCO1B1 encodes the uptake transporter OATP1B1, which can influence the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of edoxaban, polymorphisms in 
      SLCO1B1 may affect the edoxaban response. This study aimed to investigate the 
      association between SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms and the bleeding risk in patients 
      receiving edoxaban. We genotyped 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 
      the SLCO1B1 gene in patients receiving edoxaban. We also analyzed rs3842 of ABCB1 
      as a confounder. The odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR) were calculated from 
      univariate and multivariable analysis, respectively. The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was constructed for the discrimination of 
      the model. A total of 159 patients receiving edoxaban were analyzed. Overdose and 
      rs4149056 showed significant association with bleeding complications by around 
      11- and 5.5-fold, respectively. Additionally, patients with the rs4149057 variant 
      allele (C) had a 3.9-fold increased bleeding risk compared with wild-type 
      homozygote carriers (TT), whereas rs2306283 variant homozygote (GG) carriers had 
      a 0.27-fold reduced bleeding risk compared with wild-type allele (A) carriers. 
      Patients with the variant-type homozygote (CC) of ABCB1 rs3842 had a higher 
      bleeding risk than T allele carriers (AOR = 5.3 and 5.9). The final models for 
      multivariable analyses were acceptable based on the AUROC values (> 0.70). These 
      findings may help predict bleeding risk in patients taking edoxaban and help 
      personalize treatment.

TI  - Modelling and simulation of edoxaban exposure and response relationships in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 925-36
LID - 10.1160/TH11-08-0566 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is a novel, orally available, highly specific direct inhibitor of factor 
      Xa and is currently being developed for the treatment and prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism and prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The objectives of the present analyses 
      were to characterise edoxaban population pharmacokinetics (PPK) and identify 
      potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting variability in edoxaban 
      exposure, determine if there are relationships between edoxaban pharmacokinetics 
      or biomarkers and the risk of bleeding in patients with NVAF using an 
      exposure-response model, and to use the PPK and exposure-response model to 
      support dose selection for a phase III trial of edoxaban in patients with NVAF. 
      PPK analysis of data from 1,281 edoxaban-dosed subjects with intrinsic factors 
      such as renal impairment or NVAF and extrinsic factors such as concomitant 
      medications revealed significant effects of renal impairment and concomitant 
      strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban. 
      Exposure-response analysis found that in patients with NVAF, the incidence of 
      bleeding events increased significantly with increasing edoxaban exposure, with 
      steady-state minimum concentration (Cmin,ss) showing the strongest association. 
      Clinical trial simulations of bleeding incidence were used to select 30 mg and 60 
      mg once-daily edoxaban with 50% dose reductions for patients with moderate renal 
      impairment or receiving concomitant strong P-gp inhibitors as the treatment 
      regimens in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (NCT00781391) trial.

TI  - Associations among Plasma Concentrations of Edoxaban and M-4, Prothrombin Time, 
      and the SLCO1B1*15 Haplotype in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 409-416
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000001042 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The authors aimed to examine the impact of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein, the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion 
      transporter protein 1B1, cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A5, and carboxylesterase-1 ( 
      CES1 ) on the steady-state dose-adjusted trough concentrations of edoxaban (C Edo 
      /D) and M-4 (C M-4 /D). They also investigated whether C M-4 and C Edo affect 
      prothrombin time (PT). METHODS: The analyses included 152 patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) undergoing AF catheter ablation. The 
      CYP3A5*3 ; CES1 c.1168-33A>C, c.257+885T>C; SLCO1B1 c.388A>G, c.521T>C; and ABCB1 
      c.3435C>T, c.2677G>A/T, c.1236C>T genotypes were determined. RESULTS: Stepwise 
      selection multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that creatinine 
      clearance (Ccr), concomitant use of amiodarone, and SLCO1B1*15 haplotype status 
      were independent factors influencing C M-4 /D (partial R2 = 0.189, 0.098, 0.067, 
      respectively, all P values < 0.005). Ccr and concomitant use of amiodarone were 
      independent factors influencing C Edo /D (partial R2 = 0.260, 0.117, 
      respectively, both P value < 0.001). C Edo and C M-4 showed a weak correlation 
      with PT (ρ = 0.369 and 0.315, both P values < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      information concerning Ccr, concomitant use of amiodarone, and SLCO1B1*15 
      haplotype may be useful in assessing the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban, further 
      studies are needed to clarify the requirement of PT monitoring at the trough 
      level for dose adjustment of edoxaban in patients with NVAF.

AB  - With the rising prevalence of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in the 
      general population, the development of new drugs for prevention of thromboembolic 
      events is essential. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have 
      been shown to present a number of advantages over conventionally used agents, 
      such as predictable pharmacokinetics and no requirement for continuous 
      anticoagulant monitoring. The most recently approved NOAC for the NVAF indication 
      is edoxaban. Several subgroup analyses from the edoxaban phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 
      48 trial have now been published, alongside meta-analysis data comparing the four 
      currently approved NOACs. Consequently, an updated review of the literature is 
      merited. Areas covered: A PubMed search using the terms 'edoxaban', 'non-vitamin 
      K antagonist oral anticoagulant', 'ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48', and 'atrial fibrillation' 
      was performed and results screened for the most relevant English language 
      publications. The market position, pharmacological profile, clinical efficacy, 
      safety and tolerability of edoxaban are presented and discussed. Expert 
      commentary: Edoxaban has been shown to have an efficacy similar or superior to 
      that of warfarin, with a potentially lower risk of major bleeding and 
      predictable, dose-dependent pharmacology. In order to clarify its position within 
      the NOAC market, head-to-head comparative studies are required.

TI  - Managing patients taking edoxaban in dentistry.
PG  - e308-e311
LID - 10.4317/jced.53431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation therapy is used in several conditions to prevent or 
      treat thromboembolism. A new group of oral anticoagulants with clear advantages 
      over classic dicoumarin oral anticoagulants (warfarin and acenocoumarol) has been 
      developed in recent years. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 
      edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Their advantages include: 
      predictable pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and limited food, rapid onset of 
      action and short half-life. However, they lack a specific reversal agent. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This paper examines the available evidence regarding 
      rivaroxaban and sets out proposals for clinical guidance of dental practitioners 
      treating these patients in primary dental care. A literature search was conducted 
      through July 2016 for publications in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the 
      keywords "edoxaban", "dabigatran", "rivaroxaban", "apixaban", "new oral 
      anticoagulants", "novel oral anticoagulants", "bleeding" and "dental treatment" 
      with the "and" boolean operator in the last 10 years. RESULTS: The number of 
      patients taking edoxaban is increasing. There is no need for regular coagulation 
      monitoring of patients on edoxaban therapy. For patients requiring minor oral 
      surgery procedures, interruption of edoxaban is not generally necessary. 
      Management of patients on anticoagulation therapy requires that dentists can 
      accurately assess the patient prior to dental treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Their 
      increased use means that oral care clinicians should have a sound understanding 
      of the mechanism of action, pharmacology, reversal strategies and management of 
      bleeding in patients taking edoxaban. There is a need for further clinical 
      studies in order to establish more evidence-based guidelines for dental patients 
      requiring edoxaban. Key words:Edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, novel 
      oral anticoagulants, bleeding.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer patients 
      with venous thromboembolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased 7-fold in 
      patients with cancer than in those without. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the 
      standard treatment for cancer-associated VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      are not inferior to low-molecular-weight heparin with respect to the general 
      outcome of recurrent VTE. Warfarin is associated with a risk of bleeding when 
      used in combination with gefitinib or erlotinib which are epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). It is unclear, however, 
      whether combination treatments with EGFR-TKIs and DOACs pose the same risk. We 
      aimed to identify anticancer drugs and anticoagulants that can be used safely in 
      combination, as accompanying research to an observational study on VTE incidence 
      rates in lung cancer patients (Rising-VTE/NEJ037 study). METHODS: Twelve patients 
      receiving EFGR-TKI monotherapy and VTE treatment were enrolled. Blood samples 
      were collected in time series after the first dose of edoxaban, and further 
      samples were collected within 8-15 days after administering EGFR-TKIs. The 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban were analyzed using a non-compartmental model. 
      RESULTS: Edoxaban concentrations (30 mg once daily) were measured in eight 
      patients. PK analyses showed no significant differences before and after 
      co-administration of EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings indicate that the PK of edoxaban was not considerably affected by 
      co-administration of EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib).

LID - S1538-7836(25)00412-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jtha.2025.06.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation affects nearly half of geriatric inpatients, with 
      edoxaban frequently used for stroke prevention. However, geriatric patients are 
      underrepresented in drug trials with edoxaban. The limited data and high 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) variability result in using this high-risk medication 
      without a full understanding of its exposure in this population. OBJECTIVES: To 
      characterize the dose-exposure relationship and predict the sufficiency of 
      current fixed-dose guideline for geriatric patients. METHODS: We conducted a 
      single-center prospective PK study in geriatric inpatients. We built a population 
      PK model and used it to simulate various dosing strategies (n = 1000 
      simulations). RESULTS: Seventeen frail geriatric patients (median age, 87 years; 
      IQR, 83-90) receiving routine edoxaban contributed a total of 85 steady-state PK 
      samples. A 2-compartment population PK model best described the edoxaban and M4 
      metabolite concentrations, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reducing relative 
      bioavailability by 24%. Key parameters included an absorption rate constant of 
      0.104 per hour, clearance of 9.02 L/h, and central and peripheral volumes of 47.4 
      L and 42.7 L, respectively. Edoxaban concentrations correlated with factor Xa 
      inhibitor concentrations (ρ = .966). Nearly half of the patients had minimum 
      concentrations > 43 ng/mL, with no difference between PPI and non-PPI groups. 
      Simulations showed a 6.75% probability of overexposure with 15 mg, 42.4% with 30 
      mg, and 84.25% with 60 mg. CONCLUSION: Estimated PK parameters in geriatric 
      patients differed from those reported in pivotal trial populations, suggesting 
      increased exposure, thereby potentially influencing bleeding risk. The impact of 
      PPIs was not clinically relevant. Further investigation is needed to assess the 
      benefits of alternative dosing in this population.

TI  - Clinical relevance of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of edoxaban 
      when treating patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
PG  - 113-122
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for stroke. It is most 
      prevalent in the elderly and frequently coexists with heart failure (HF). The 
      joint occurrence of AF and HF further worsens prognosis. The prevention of 
      thromboembolism is crucial in the management of AF. In recent years, new oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) have been licensed for the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism in patients with AF. Areas covered: This article reviews the 
      key published studies on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of 
      edoxaban, the latest NOAC to receive approval for the AF indication. This potent 
      and selective inhibitor of factor Xa shows predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in the 
      pivotal, phase III, warfarin-controlled ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial in 21,105 AF 
      patients. Expert opinion: NOACs will likely improve the management of AF, with or 
      without HF. Edoxaban has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile that supports its 
      use in special patient populations, including patients aged ≥75 years, with HF,

TI  - Edoxaban Versus Warfarin in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and History of 
      Liver Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with liver disease have increased risk of thrombosis and 
      bleeding but are typically excluded from trials of direct oral anticoagulant 
      agents. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
      pharmacodynamics (PD), clinical efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin 
      in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and history of liver disease. METHODS: 
      ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in 
      Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction Study 48) was a 
      randomized, double-blind trial comparing edoxaban with warfarin in patients with 
      AF followed for 2.8 years. History of liver disease was defined as 
      investigator-reported liver disease or >2-fold transaminase elevation at 
      randomization. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints of stroke or systemic 
      embolic event (SSEE) and major bleeding were assessed stratified by history of 
      liver disease. PK/PD assessments of edoxaban included endogenous and extrinsic 
      factor Xa activity and edoxaban concentration. RESULTS: Among 21,105 patients, 
      1,083 (5.1%) had a history of liver disease; they had a higher prevalence of many 
      comorbidities. The adjusted risks of SSEE were similar (adjusted hazard ratio 
      [HR(adj)]: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 1.22; p = 0.50), but major 
      bleeding was more common in patients with liver disease (HR(adj): 1.38; 95% CI: 
      1.10 to 1.74; p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in PK/PD 
      assessment of edoxaban in patients with versus without liver disease. The HRs for 
      higher-dose edoxaban versus warfarin for SSEE were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.73 to 1.01) in 
      patients without and 1.11 (95% CI: 0.54 to 2.30) with liver disease (p for 
      interaction [p(int)] = 0.47), major bleeding 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.91) in 
      patients without and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.56 to 1.47) with liver disease 
      (p(int) = 0.63). There were no significant differences in hepatic adverse events 
      between the 2 treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AF receiving 
      oral anticoagulation, bleeding, but not thromboembolic events, was increased in 
      patients with liver disease. A history of liver disease did not alter the 
      relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban compared with warfarin. Hepatic adverse 
      events were similar between edoxaban and warfarin.

TI  - Using Pharmacogenetics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants to Predict Changes in Their 
      Pharmacokinetics and the Risk of Adverse Drug Reactions.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9050451 [doi]
LID - 451
AB  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) that are increasingly used worldwide. Taking into account their 
      widespread use for the prevention of thromboembolism in cardiology, neurology, 
      orthopedics, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) as well as their different 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics dependence, it is critical to explore new 
      opportunities for DOACs administration and predict their dosage when used as 
      monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. In this review, we describe the 
      details of the relative pharmacogenetics on the pharmacokinetics of DOACs as well 
      as new data concerning the clinical characteristics that predetermine the needed 
      dosage and the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The usefulness of genetic 
      information before and shortly after the initiation of DOACs is also discussed. 
      The reasons for particular attention to these issues are not only new genetic 
      knowledge and genotyping possibilities, but also the risk of serious ADRs 
      (primarily, gastrointestinal bleeding). Taking into account the effect of the 
      carriership of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of genes encoding 
      biotransformation enzymes and DOACs metabolism, the use of these measures is 
      important to predict changes in pharmacokinetics and the risk of ADRs in patients 
      with a high risk of thromboembolism who receive anticoagulant therapy.

TI  - Bioavailability and Safety of the Factor Xa Inhibitor Edoxaban and the Effects of 
      Quinidine in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 358-66
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor under 
      investigation for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and for 
      treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. This study 
      evaluated edoxaban absolute bioavailability and effects of the P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitor quinidine on edoxaban pharmacokinetics after intravenous edoxaban 
      administration. METHODS: Healthy volunteers received three treatments in a 
      randomized sequence: single oral 60-mg edoxaban dose, single intravenous 30-mg 
      edoxaban dose, and concomitant single intravenous 30-mg edoxaban dose with 
      quinidine 300 mg every 8 hours for 4 days. The primary objective was to determine 
      absolute bioavailability of edoxaban. Secondary objectives included 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban after oral or intravenous 
      administration, quinidine effect on intravenous edoxaban pharmacokinetics, and 
      safety. RESULTS: Thirty-six subjects were randomized; five discontinued (three 
      for adverse events [AEs]). Edoxaban oral absolute bioavailability was 61.8%. With 
      concomitant quinidine, total edoxaban exposure increased ∼35% and total clearance 
      decreased ∼25%. Coagulation parameters increased after edoxaban administration in 
      most subjects, but returned to baseline within 24 hours postdose. No deaths, 
      serious AEs, or bleeding-related AEs occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute 
      bioavailability of edoxaban in healthy volunteers was established (61.8%). 
      Edoxaban, administered orally or intravenously, appeared to be safe and well 
      tolerated.

TI  - An integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomic analysis of ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 
      polymorphisms on edoxaban exposure.
PG  - 153-159
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2016.82 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban and its low-abundance, active metabolite M4 are substrates of 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR1) and organic anion transporter protein 1B1 (OATP1B1), 
      respectively, and pharmacological inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 can affect 
      edoxaban and M4 pharmacokinetics (PK). In this integrated pharmacogenomic 
      analysis, genotype and concentration-time data from 458 healthy volunteers in 14 
      completed phase 1 studies were pooled to examine the impact on edoxaban PK 
      parameters of allelic variants of ABCB1 (rs1045642: C3435T) and SLCO1B1 
      (rs4149056: T521C), which encode for P-gp and OATP1B1. Although some 
      pharmacologic inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 increase edoxaban exposure, neither 
      the ABCB1 C3435T nor the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism affected edoxaban PK. A 
      slight elevation in M4 exposure was observed among SLCO1B1 C-allele carriers; 
      however, this elevation is unlikely to be clinically significant as plasma M4 
      concentrations comprise <10% of total edoxaban levels.

TI  - Anticoagulant therapy with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban and the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate in patients 
      with hepatic impairment.
PG  - 243-54
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0034-0 [doi]
AB  - The direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and the 
      thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) have gained approval for use 
      in several indications, most notably for the prevention and treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) and for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. Hepatic impairment can affect the disposition of these 
      anticoagulants considerably not only because of the hepatic metabolism of the 
      direct FXa inhibitors but also because moderate to severely impaired hepatic 
      function will affect coagulation. This review describes the key pharmacological 
      properties of novel oral anticoagulants with special attention to patients with 
      impaired hepatic function. In subjects with moderately impaired liver function 
      (i.e. Child-Pugh classification B), the area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC) of rivaroxaban (10 mg single dose) is increased by 2.27-fold, which 
      is paralleled by an increase in FXa inhibition. The AUC of apixaban (5 mg single 
      dose) is increased by 1.09-fold, whereas the AUC of edoxaban (15 mg single dose) 
      is decreased by 4.8 % and the AUC of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) is decreased 
      by 5.6 %. Specific labelling restrictions for rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      dabigatran regarding impaired hepatic function are based on both the Child-Pugh 
      classification and liver-related exclusion criteria applied in pivotal clinical 
      trials. Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease 
      associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk, including 
      cirrhotic patients classified as Child-Pugh B and C. Apixaban can be used with 
      caution in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic 
      impairment or in patients with alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
      aminotransferase levels >2× upper limit of normal (ULN). Apixaban is not 
      recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in 
      those with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant 
      bleeding risk. Dabigatran is not recommended in patients with elevated liver 
      enzymes (>2× ULN). Dabigatran is contraindicated in patients with hepatic 
      impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival. Currently, 
      edoxaban is not available in the US or European markets. However, the Japanese 
      label did not restrict use in hepatic dysfunction but advises care in patients 
      with severe hepatic impairment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended in preference to 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) eligible for oral anticoagulation therapy; however, data and 
      clinical experiences supporting the use of DOACs in patients with a body mass 
      index ≥40 kg/m(2) or weight >120 kg remain limited. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of DOACs in patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity. METHODS: We enrolled all consecutive patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity undergoing treatment with DOACs followed up at Monaldi Hospital, Naples, 
      Italy. To determine peak plasma and trough levels of DOACs, plasma samples were 
      collected at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th hours from the last dose intake in patients 
      receiving apixaban and dabigatran and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 24th hours in 
      those receiving edoxaban and rivaroxaban. The DOACs' peak and trough plasma 
      levels obtained from our study population were compared with those sourced from 
      pharmacokinetic studies among patients without obesity, defined as a normal 
      reference range in the literature. If at least 1 peak or trough plasma level was 
      found ​​below or above the normal reference ranges, the patients were classified 
      as having out-of-range DOAC plasma levels. Study population was then divided into 
      in-range and out-of-range groups. Baseline characteristics, including DOAC 
      treatment, were compared between the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis were performed to identify baseline variables 
      associated with DOACs' plasma concentration out of the expected range. FINDINGS: 
      A total of 58 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.93 [8.73] years; 40% female) with 
      extreme obesity (mean [SD] body mass index. 44.43 [3.54] kg/m(2)) and AF while 
      undergoing DOAC treatment were included in the present study. In 9 patients (15.5 
      %), the DOAC plasma concentrations were out of the expected ranges (out-of-range 
      group);, indicating a greater likelihood of edoxaban 30 mg treatment (33% vs 2%; 
      P < 0.01) and inappropriate DOAC underdosing (56% vs 4%; P < 0.005) compared with 
      the in-range group. According to the multivariate logistic analysis (P = 0.0011), 
      the inappropriate DOAC underdosing (hazard ratio = 29.37; P = 0.0002) was an 
      independent predictor of DOAC plasma levels out of the expected ranges. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Patients with extreme obesity and AF who were receiving DOAC 
      therapy had DOAC plasma concentrations in the expected range. The inappropriate 
      DOAC underdosing seems to be the only independent clinical factor associated with 
      a plasma concentration of the drug out of the expected range.

AB  - BACKGROUND: D-dimer levels can predict ischemic stroke in patients with acute 
      heart failure (AHF). However, the effects of direct oral anticoagulants on 
      D-dimer levels have not been investigated during admission for AHF in patients 
      with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study examined D-dimer levels immediately 
      after admission and following edoxaban initiation as a sub-analysis of a 
      multi-center study that investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      edoxaban in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) and AHF. METHODS: Hospitalized 
      patients with NVAF and AHF received edoxaban according to the label. The primary 
      measure was the change in D-dimer levels on 7 consecutive days after admission 
      for AHF. We also investigated differences according to prior edoxaban use (de 
      novo at the time of admission or continuation). RESULTS: In 10/13 (76.9%) de novo 
      patients, D-dimer levels exceeded the reference value (1.0 µg/mL) at admission 
      (mean, 2.12 µg/mL) and subsequently decreased in 9 patients (at final blood 
      sampling: mean, 1.12 µg/mL); 1 patient did not fall below the reference value due 
      to stasis dermatitis. In the continuation group, most patients had D-dimer levels 
      below the reference value from Day 1 (mean, 0.93 µg/mL), and levels remained 
      stable or decreased (at final blood sampling: mean, 0.49 µg/mL). No events of 
      stroke were observed. CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer levels may be elevated in patients 
      with NVAF and AHF, particularly in those without prior anticoagulant treatment. 
      Edoxaban may be effective for lowering and keeping D-dimer levels, a biomarker 
      for predicting ischemic stroke, below the reference value in patients with NVAF 
      and AHF.

TI  - Abnormally high plasma concentrations of M-4, the active metabolite of edoxaban, 
      at the onset of acute kidney injury in a patient receiving rifampin and 
      clarithromycin: a case report.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/s40780-024-00390-6 [doi]
LID - 66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, the only factor Xa inhibitor with active metabolites, is 
      metabolized by carboxylesterase-1 to its main active metabolite, M-4, which is a 
      substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and is excreted 
      in bile and urine. Because the area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      ratio of M-4 to parent compound is typically less than 10% in healthy subjects, 
      M-4 is generally considered to exhibit negligible antithrombotic activity in 
      patients treated with edoxaban. However, we identified a case in which drug 
      interactions and kidney impairment led to a substantive increase in plasma M-4 
      concentrations. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report involved a 68-year-old man 
      with pancreatic cancer who was orally administered edoxaban tablets for 
      prevention of thrombus formation in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, in addition 
      to rifampin and clarithromycin (CAM) for treatment of mycobacterium avium complex 
      lung disease. These medications were temporarily discontinued for a 
      pancreaticoduodenectomy but were resumed 8 days post-surgery (POD8). On POD9, the 
      patient developed acute kidney injury, and the trough concentrations of edoxaban 
      and M-4 were 131.1 ng/mL and 115.8 ng/mL, respectively (M-4 ratio: 88.3%). On 
      POD11, the M-4 trough concentration and M-4 ratio increased to 216.2 ng/mL and 
      186.2%, respectively. The plasma concentration of coproporphyrin-I, an endogenous 
      biomarker of OATP1B1 activity, increased during this period. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      case suggests that in patients with impaired renal function taking edoxaban, 
      co-administration of carboxylesterase-1 inducers such as rifampin and/or OATP1B1 
      inhibitors such as rifampin or clarithromycin may increase plasma concentrations 
      of M-4 to clinically non-negligible levels.

TI  - Establishing Edoxaban's Role in Anticoagulation.
PG  - 228-38
LID - 10.1177/0897190016647314 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This article serves as a review of the current literature regarding the 
      role of edoxaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). SUMMARY: 
      Until recent years, oral treatment options for both treatment and prevention of 
      VTE and stroke were limited to warfarin. Dabigatran was the first new oral 
      anticoagulant approved in over 50 years followed by rivaroxaban and apixaban. 
      These new oral anticoagulants offer many benefits over warfarin. Edoxaban is the 
      newest member among the oral anticoagulants and exerts its action by direct 
      inhibition of factor Xa. It may offer some advantages in that it is the second 
      Food and Drug Administration-approved once-daily anticoagulant available and does 
      not interact with the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system. However, there are 
      concerns in patients with AF and preserved renal function (>95 mL/min), as these 
      cohorts experienced a higher incidence of stroke in trials. CONCLUSION: Based on 
      the 3 clinical trials, edoxaban appears to be a safe and effective factor Xa 
      inhibitor in patients with a creatinine clearance of <95 mL/min. It will serve as 
      an alternative anticoagulant for those with a preference for once-daily dosing 
      and/or taking medications that interact with the CYP450 system.

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11010037 [doi]
LID - 37
AB  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs). Their inter-individual variability in pharmacodynamics 
      and pharmacokinetics (transport and metabolism) is high, and could result from 
      genetic polymorphisms. As recommended by the French Network of Pharmacogenetics 
      (RNPGx), the management of some treatments in cardiovascular diseases (as 
      antiplatelet agents, oral vitamin K antagonists, and statins) can rely on genetic 
      testing in order to improve healthcare by reducing therapeutic resistance or 
      toxicity. This paper is a review of association studies between single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and systemic exposure variation of DOACs. Most of the 
      results presented here have a lot to do with some SNPs of CES1 (rs2244613, 
      rs8192935, and rs71647871) and ABCB1 (rs1128503, rs2032582, rs1045642, and 
      rs4148738) genes, and dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Regarding edoxaban 
      and betrixaban, as well as SNPs in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes, literature is 
      scarce, and further studies are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic factors affect DOAC pharmacokinetics and efficacy in atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) patients, yet no pharmacogenomic guidelines exist. This study 
      aims to assess their impact on supporting personalized therapy. METHODS: 
      Following PRISMA-2020 (PROSPERO: CRD42024592412), a systematic review analysed 31 
      studies with 8558 AF patients across Asia and Europe. Structural Equation 
      Modelling (SEM) in R Studio (v2024.12) assessed 331 genotypes affecting 
      pharmacokinetics and clinical events. Monte Carlo simulations, pathway 
      enrichment, PCA clustering, and logistic regression further refined the analysis. 
      RESULTS: Dabigatran metabolism is influenced by ABCB1 and CES1 polymorphisms, 
      with ABCB1 (rs1045642, AAAG), CES1 (rs761128900, T), and CES1 (rs71647871, AA/AG) 
      linked to low bleeding risk (<30 %), ensuring stable efficacy. Apixaban's safety 
      is associated with ABCB1 (rs2032582, AA), ABCB1 (rs1045642, CT/CT), and PXR 
      haplotype1B, minimizing bleeding/stroke risk (<20 %). Rivaroxaban effectiveness 
      is enhanced by ABCG2 (rs546230660, AG), ABCB1 (c.61236, CT), CYP3A4 (rs4646440, 
      WT), and CYP3A4 (rs55808883, CT), reducing stroke/bleeding risk (<20 %). Edoxaban 
      clearance depends on SLCO1B1 (rs11045879, TCCC) and SLCO1B1 (c.388A > G, 
      rs12317268, AGGG), maintaining stable plasma levels (stroke/bleeding risk <40 %). 
      SEM results (CFI = 0.997, TLI = 0.990, RMSEA = 0.037, SRMR = 0.031) confirm model 
      stability, logistic regression (AUC = 0.996) reinforcing findings. PCA clustering 
      identified low risk (stable drug levels, minimal bleeding risk) and moderate risk 
      (suboptimal pharmacokinetics, higher stroke/bleeding risks) 69.7 % of the total 
      variance. CONCLUSION: genetics significantly influences DOAC pharmacokinetics, 
      particularly for dabigatran and apixaban, where stroke and bleeding risks 
      correlate with Cmin and Cmax. Pharmacogenomic profiling and therapeutic drug 
      monitoring are crucial for optimizing therapy, especially in high-risk patients.

AB  - Warfarin has been a highly prevalent agent for over 70 years; however, its use 
      has been limited by drug-drug interactions, adverse events, and the need for 
      frequent monitoring. To minimize these complications, several non-vitamin K oral 
      anticoagulants have been approved, including the latest agent, edoxaban. Edoxaban 
      is a factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke/systemic embolism 
      in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism. Edoxaban was largely studied in the Edoxaban versus Warfarin in 
      Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) and Edoxaban versus 
      Warfarin for the Treatment of Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism (Hokusai-VTE) 
      trials, both showing noninferiority when compared with warfarin. Similar to other 
      oral anticoagulants, the most serious adverse effects of edoxaban are related to 
      bleeding. However, there are currently no approved reversal agents. Andexanet 
      alfa and ciraparantag are the latest agents being studied for reversal. This 
      article provides an overview of the safety and efficacy along with the advantages 
      and disadvantages of edoxaban.

TI  - Single-dose ciraparantag safely and completely reverses anticoagulant effects of 
      edoxaban.
PG  - 238-245
LID - 10.1160/TH16-03-0224 [doi]
AB  - Of the new direct oral anticoagulants, direct factor Xa inhibitors are limited by 
      the absence of a proven reversal agent. We assessed the safety, tolerability and 
      impact on anticoagulation reversal of ciraparantag (PER977) alone and following a 
      60 mg dose of the FXa inhibitor edoxaban. Escalating, single IV doses of 
      ciraparantag were administered alone and following a 60 mg oral dose of edoxaban 
      in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to healthy subjects. Serial 
      assessments of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ciraparantag 
      were performed. Eighty male subjects completed the study. Following edoxaban (60 
      mg), a single IV dose of ciraparantag (100 to 300 mg) demonstrated full reversal 
      of anticoagulation within 10 minutes and sustained for 24 hours. Fibrin diameter 
      within clots was restored to normal 30 minutes after a single dose of 100 to 300 
      mg ciraparantag as determined by scanning electron microscopy and change in 
      fibrin diameter quantified by automated image analysis. Potentially related 
      adverse events were periorbital and facial flushing and cool sensation following 
      IV injection of ciraparantag. Renal excretion of ciraparantag metabolite was the 
      main elimination route. There was no evidence of procoagulant activity following 
      ciraparantag as assessed by D-dimer, prothrombin fragments 1.2, and tissue factor 
      pathway inhibitor levels. In conclusion, ciraparantag in healthy subjects is safe 
      and well tolerated with minor, non-dose limiting adverse events. Baseline 
      haemostasis was restored from the anticoagulated state with doses of 100 to 300 
      mg ciraparantag within 10-30 minutes of administration and sustained for at least 
      24 hours.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban in Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial 
      Fibrillation in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Study, a Phase III Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1079-90
LID - 10.1007/s40262-016-0378-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Edoxaban is a novel factor Xa inhibitor. This study characterizes 
      the population pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) included in the phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, evaluates 
      covariates for the dose-exposure relationship in this population, and assesses 
      the impact of protocol-specified dose reductions on exposure using simulations. 
      METHODS: Model development was performed using NONMEM(®) and based on sparse data 
      from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study augmented with dense data from 13 phase I 
      studies to inform and stabilize the model. The influence of body weight (WT), 
      creatinine clearance (CLCR), concomitant P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, age, 
      sex, race, and NVAF on pharmacokinetic parameters was evaluated based on 
      statistical significance and clinical relevance. RESULTS: A two-compartment model 
      with first-order elimination and first-order absorption after an absorption 
      lag-time best described the data. Apparent volume and clearance terms increased 
      with increasing WT. Apparent renal clearance increased with increasing CLCR. 
      Apparent non-renal, renal, and inter-compartmental clearance terms differed 
      between phase I volunteers and NVAF patients. Asian patients were found to have 
      increased apparent central volume of distribution, bioavailability, and total 
      apparent clearance. Concomitant P-gp inhibitors increased the bioavailability 
      statistically significantly, but this did not reach clinical relevance. 
      CONCLUSION: Edoxaban disposition and the variability in this disposition, 
      including influence of covariates, after oral administration were adequately 
      characterized in patients with NVAF. The 50 % dose reduction in patients with low 
      WT (≤60 kg), moderate renal impairment (CLCR ≤50 mL/min), or concomitant P-gp 
      inhibitors led to 30 % lower exposure than in the other patients.

TI  - Impact of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4-interacting drugs on clinical outcomes in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation using non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants: a nationwide cohort study.
PG  - 722-730
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvad070 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The clinical relevance of common pharmacokinetic interactions with 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) often remains unclear. 
      Therefore, the impact of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
      on clinical outcomes in NOAC-treated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) was 
      investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: AF patients were included between 2013 and 
      2019 using Belgian nationwide data. Concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4-interacting 
      drugs at the time of NOAC initiation was identified. Among 193 072 NOAC-treated 
      AF patients, 46 194 (23.9%) and 2903 (1.5%) subjects concomitantly used a 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, 
      concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors was associated with significantly 
      higher major bleeding [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) (1.18-1.30)] and all-cause mortality risks [aHR 1.07, 95% CI (1.02-1.11)], 
      but not with thromboembolism in NOAC-treated AF patients. A significantly 
      increased risk of major bleeding was observed with amiodarone [aHR 1.27, 95% CI 
      (1.21-1.34)], diltiazem [aHR 1.28, 95% CI (1.13-1.46)], verapamil [aHR 1.36, 95% 
      CI (1.03-1.80)], ticagrelor [aHR 1.50, 95% CI (1.20-1.87)], and clarithromycin 
      [aHR 1.55, 95% CI (1.14-2.11)]; and in edoxaban [aHR 1.24, 95% CI (1.06-1.45)], 
      rivaroxaban [aHR 1.25, 95% CI (1.16-1.34)], and apixaban users [aHR 1.27, 95% CI 
      (1.16-1.39)], but not in dabigatran users [aHR 1.07, 95% CI (0.94-1.23)]. 
      Concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. antiepileptic drugs like 
      levetiracetam) was associated with a significantly higher stroke risk [aHR 1.31, 
      95% CI (1.03-1.68)], but not with bleeding or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: 
      Concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors was associated with higher bleeding and 
      all-cause mortality risks in NOAC users, whereas the use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers 
      was associated with higher stroke risks.

TI  - A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: 
      method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation.
PG  - 1203-1212
LID - 10.1111/bjh.17470 [doi]
AB  - A universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate 
      widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analysing spiked samples 
      and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicentre 
      cross-sectional study, including 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily 
      available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and 
      correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. Anti-Xa activity was 
      measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in 
      addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also 
      determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity 
      correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban drug levels [r(s) 
       = 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·98-0·98]. The sensitivity for the 
      clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50 and 100 µg/l was 96·2% (95% CI 
      94·4-97·4), 96·4% (95% CI 94·4-97·7) and 96·7% (95% CI 94·3-98·1) respectively. 
      Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study. In conclusion, 
      a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug 
      concentrations in clinical practice.

AB  - Edoxaban is the most recent available representative of the Non-Vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC). The approval was based on the largest 
      phase III trials of NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF, ENGAGE-AF), and for the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE, HOKUSAI-VTE). In both trials, edoxaban was associated with 
      similar efficacy and a significant reduction in bleeding events with respect to 
      the pre-defined primary safety endpoints, as compared to warfarin.Additionally, 
      the once daily dosing of edoxaban, the clinically investigated strategy for 
      dose-reduction based on clearly defined criteria and the favorable 
      pharmacokinetic profile might further support the clinical applicability of the 
      substance.In the light of recent data, this expert consensus document aims to 
      summarize the latest clinical trial results while providing a concise overview of 
      current guideline recommendations on the management of patients with non-valvular 
      AF and VTE.

TI  - Reversing the anticoagulation effects of dabigatran.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.1080/21548331.2017.1298389 [doi]
AB  - The standard of care for oral anticoagulation therapy has primarily been 
      warfarin, which is limited by its indirect mechanism-of-action, variable 
      kinetics, tolerability, and routine monitoring concerns. The direct-acting oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) have predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      and improved safety and efficacy compared to warfarin for the prevention of 
      stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and prevention or 
      management of venous thromboembolism. Consequential bleeding is a concern with 
      all anticoagulants. Vitamin K is not a rapid reversal agent for warfarin; rather 
      it facilitates synthesis of new vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which can 
      take longer than 24 h. Other nonspecific agents, including recombinant activated 
      factor VII, three- and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), and 
      activated PCC or Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA®), are options 
      based on clinical need. Specific agents to quickly reverse the effects of DOACs 
      have been under development, and idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment 
      that rapidly binds dabigatran, has been approved for clinical use in cases of 
      dabigatran-related life-threatening bleeding, or if a dabigatran-treated patient 
      needs emergency surgery or an invasive procedure. Idarucizumab specifically and 
      rapidly reverses dabigatran-induced anticoagulation as measured by established 
      coagulation assays. However, this does not guarantee complete hemostasis, 
      especially if a patient has underlying comorbidities such as renal or liver 
      disease, or has experienced recent trauma that requires urgent surgery. In these 
      cases, concomitant supportive therapy and/or administration of concentrated 
      clotting factors may be considered. Emerging data from ongoing trials and 
      clinical experience will further inform providers regarding optimal approaches 
      for anticoagulation reversal.

TI  - Edoxaban: a focused review of its clinical pharmacology.
PG  - 1844-55
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu181 [doi]
AB  - Long-term anticoagulation treatment with warfarin has been associated with a 
      number of limitations in clinical practice and there is a need for more 
      convenient long-term anticoagulation treatment. One of the non-vitamin K oral 
      anticoagulants in development is edoxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor that is 
      administered once daily. The pharmacological properties of edoxaban have various 
      advantages in anticoagulant therapy. Edoxaban quickly reaches peak plasma 
      concentrations in 1.5 h, has a half-life of 10-14 h, has relatively high 
      bioavailability of 62% and exhibits highly selective, competitive, 
      concentration-dependent inhibition of human factor Xa. The plasma concentrations 
      of edoxaban are also closely correlated with suppression of thrombin generation 
      and a range of platelet activation parameters (fragment 1+2, 
      thrombin-antithrombin complex, and β-thromboglobulin), which edoxaban has been 
      shown to rapidly inhibit. The anticoagulant activity of edoxaban is not affected 
      by food intake or ethnicity and a number of drug-drug interaction studies have 
      been performed. Co-administration of edoxaban with strong P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitors, such as dronedarone, quinidine, and verapamil requires edoxaban 
      dose-reduction by 50% to avoid the risk of over-exposure. The exposure of 
      edoxaban may also increase in patients with a body weight ≤60 kg and moderate 
      renal impairment. This meant a dose-reduction strategy in patients at risk of 
      over-exposure was utilized in Phase III clinical studies. In conclusion, the 
      pharmacological properties of edoxaban provide rapid and specific inhibition of 
      factor Xa, which is closely related to plasma concentrations. Given the 
      limitations with long-term warfarin therapy, once-daily edoxaban may provide a 
      convenient long-term alternative for patients.

TI  - Edoxaban: an update on the new oral direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 1209-31
LID - 10.1007/s40265-014-0261-1 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is a once-daily oral anticoagulant that rapidly and selectively inhibits 
      factor Xa in a concentration-dependent manner. This review describes the 
      extensive clinical development program of edoxaban, including phase III studies 
      in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and symptomatic venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study (N = 21,105; mean CHADS2 score 
      2.8) compared edoxaban 60 mg once daily (high-dose regimen) and edoxaban 30 mg 
      once daily (low-dose regimen) with dose-adjusted warfarin [international 
      normalized ratio (INR) 2.0-3.0] and found that both regimens were non-inferior to 
      warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF. 
      Both edoxaban regimens also provided significant reductions in the risk of 
      hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular mortality, major bleeding and intracranial 
      bleeding. The Hokusai-VTE study (N = 8,292) in patients with symptomatic VTE had 
      a flexible treatment duration of 3-12 months and found that following initial 
      heparin, edoxaban 60 mg once daily was non-inferior to dose-adjusted warfarin 
      (INR 2.0-3.0) for the prevention of recurrent VTE, and also had a significantly 
      lower risk of bleeding events. Both studies randomized patients at 
      moderate-to-high risk of thromboembolic events and were further designed to 
      simulate routine clinical practice as much as possible, with edoxaban dose 
      reduction (halving dose) at randomisation or during the study if required, a 
      frequently monitored and well-controlled warfarin group, a well-monitored 
      transition period at study end and a flexible treatment duration in Hokusai-VTE. 
      Given the phase III results obtained, once-daily edoxaban may soon be a key 
      addition to the range of antithrombotic treatment options.

      vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The randomized, double-blind Hokusai-VTE 
      trial demonstrated that 60 mg of edoxaban once daily following initial heparin 
      treatment is non-inferior to heparin overlapped with and followed by warfarin for 
      the treatment of VTE, and is associated with significantly fewer bleeding events. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin among 
      East Asian patients enrolled in the Hokusai-VTE trial. PATIENTS/METHODS: The 
      Hokusai-VTE trial enrolled 8292 patients from 439 centers worldwide, including 
      1109 patients from Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The primary efficacy and 
      safety outcomes were symptomatic recurrent VTE and clinically relevant bleeding, 
      respectively. RESULTS: In the overall East Asian population, the primary efficacy 
      outcome of symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 16 of 563 (2.8%) patients in the 
      edoxaban group versus 24 of 538 (4.5%) patients in the warfarin group (hazard 
      ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-1.19; P = 0.1601). The primary 
      safety outcome of clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 56 of 563 (9.9%) 
      patients in the edoxaban group versus 93 of 538 (17.3%) patients in the warfarin 
      group (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.40-0.78; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban is an 
      effective and safer alternative to warfarin in East Asian patients with acute VTE 
      who require anticoagulant therapy, consistent with overall study findings from 
      the Hokusai-VTE trial.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are still the most important cause of morbidity and 
      mortality worldwide and anti-thrombotic treatment is widely used as a result. The 
      currently used drugs include heparin and its derivatives, vitamin K antagonists, 
      though efficacious, have their own set of limitations like unpredictable 
      pharmacokinetic profile, parenteral route (with heparin and its derivatives 
      only), narrow therapeutic window, and constant laboratory monitoring for their 
      efficacy and safety. This lead to the development of novel factor Xa inhibitors 
      which could be given orally, have predictable dose response relationship and are 
      associated with lesser hemorrhagic complications. They include rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban among others. Apixaban has currently been approved for use 
      in patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery and to prevent 
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Many trials are ongoing for apixaban 
      to firmly establish its place in future, among the anti-thrombotic drugs.

TI  - Use of direct oral anticoagulants in daily practice.
PG  - 57-72
AB  - In recent years, the options for anticoagulant therapy have examined new direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) 
      and direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). These 
      agents represent further progress towards the ideal anticoagulant drug and thus 
      towards a safe and effective antithrombotic therapy. The ideal anticoagulant is 
      oral and has a wide therapeutic range, predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, a rapid onset of action, an available antidote, minimal side 
      effects, and minimal interactions with other drugs or food. This review addresses 
      the practical considerations for physicians in DOAC use, including indication, 
      dosage, monitoring, pharmacokinetic profile, drug-drug interaction, and reversal 
      of direct anticoagulation effects in case of bleeding.

TI  - Effect of edoxaban on markers of coagulation in venous and shed blood compared 
      with fondaparinux.
PG  - 1080-90
LID - 10.1160/TH10-11-0705 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor, is in phase III clinical 
      development for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism. The shed blood model allows for study of activated coagulation 
      at a site of standardised tissue injury due to local release of tissue factor. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three doses of edoxaban 
      on markers of coagulation in shed and venous blood versus placebo and a standard 
      prophylactic dose of fondaparinux. A total of 100 healthy male subjects were 
      randomised to receive single doses of one of five treatments: subcutaneously 
      administered fondaparinux 2.5 mg; orally administered edoxaban 30, 60, or 120 mg; 
      or placebo. The primary objective was measurement of blood coagulation markers 
      prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, and 
      platelet activation marker β-thromboglobulin (β-TG), in venous and shed blood. 
      Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics, shed blood volume, and safety of 
      edoxaban. Single doses of edoxaban caused rapid and significant decreases of 
      F1+2, TAT, and β-TG in the shed blood model, indicating inhibition of thrombin 
      generation and platelet activation. Inhibition was significantly less for 
      fondaparinux versus edoxaban. Baseline-corrected F1+2, TAT, and β-TG values 
      demonstrated sustained inhibition up to 24 hours for shed blood in the edoxaban 
      groups but no significant inhibition in venous blood. Overall, edoxaban 
      treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, single oral doses of edoxaban 30, 
      60, or 120 mg caused rapid and sustained inhibition of coagulation up to 24 hours 
      in the shed blood model.

PG  - 979-987
LID - 10.1007/s11912-023-01428-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence and 
      highlight the areas of uncertainty regarding direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) 
      for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CAT). RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 
      years, four RCTs have shown that rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban are at least 
      as effective as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of both 
      incidental and symptomatic CAT. On the other hand, these drugs increase the risk 
      of major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cancer at this site. Another 
      two RCTs have demonstrated that apixaban and rivaroxaban also prevent CAT in 
      subjects at intermediate-to-high risk commencing chemotherapy, albeit at the 
      price of higher likelihood of bleeding. By contrast, data are limited about the 
      use DOAC in individuals with intracranial tumors or concomitant thrombocytopenia. 
      It is also possible that some anticancer agents heighten the effects of DOAC via 
      pharmacokinetic interactions, up to making their effectiveness-safety profile 
      unfavorable. Leveraging the results of the aforementioned RCTS, current 
      guidelines recommend DOAC as the anticoagulants of choice for CAT treatment and, 
      in selected cases, prevention. However, the benefit of DOAC is less defined in 
      specific patient subgroups, in which the choice of DOAC over LMWH should be 
      carefully pondered.

      These new inhibitors include chemical small molecules (asundexian and milvexian), 
      monoclonal antibodies (abelacimab, osocimab, and xisomab), and antisense 
      oligonucleotides (IONIS-FXIRX and fesomersen), and thus, they have very peculiar 
      and different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Besides their 
      clinical efficacy and safety, based on their pharmacological heterogeneity, the 
      use of these drugs in patients with comorbidities may undergo drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) with other concomitant therapies. Although only little 
      clinical evidence is available, it is possible to predict clinically relevant DDI 
      by taking into consideration their pharmacokinetic properties, such as the 
      CYP450-dependent metabolism, the interaction with drug transporters, and/or the 
      route of elimination. These characteristics may be useful to differentiate their 
      use with the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) anti -FXa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      edoxaban) and thrombin (dabigatran), whose pharmacokinetics are strongly 
      dependent from P-gp inhibitors/inducers. In the present review, we summarize the 
      current clinical evidence on DDIs of new anti FXI with CYP450/P-gp inhibitors and 
      inducers and indicate potential differences with DOAC anti FXa.

AB  - To establish a rapid and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem 
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban in rat plasma. The analytes and the internal standard 
      (diazepam) were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 chromatography column 
      (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) using gradient elution with a mobile phase of 
      acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The 
      detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by 
      multiple reaction monitoring mode to monitor the precursor-to-product ion 
      transitions of m/z 436.1 → 145.1 for rivaroxaban, m/z 460.0 → 443.1 for apixaban, 
      m/z 548.2 → 366.1 for edoxaban and m/z 285.2 → 193.1 for diazepam (IS) using a 
      positive electrospray ionization interface. The method was validated over a 
      concentration range of 1.0-200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban, 1.0-100 ng/mL for apixaban 
      and 1.0-500 ng/mL for edoxaban. Total time for each chromatograph was 3.5 min. 
      The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control samples at 
      low, medium, and high concentration levels exhibited relative standard deviations 
      <10.5 % and the accuracy values ranged from -9.9 to 11.3 %. The method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban in rats.

TI  - Edoxaban administration following enoxaparin: a pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, 
      and tolerability assessment in human subjects.
PG  - 166-75
LID - 10.1160/TH11-09-0676 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral direct factor (F)Xa inhibitor in advanced stages of clinical 
      development. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of enoxaparin 1 mg/kg followed 12 hours (h) 
      post-dose by edoxaban 60 mg, which is the regimen being used in the phase III 
      study of edoxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (Hokusai-VTE). This 
      was a phase I, open-label, randomised, four-period, four-treatment cross-over 
      study. Treatments were edoxaban alone (EDOX), enoxaparin alone (ENOX), edoxaban 
      plus enoxaparin (EDOX+ENOX), and enoxaparin followed by edoxaban 12 h later 
      (ENOX12-EDOX). Serial blood samples were collected for PD (thrombin generation, 
      anti-FXa) and pharmacokinetic (PK) variables (edoxaban and its principal 
      metabolite M4 by LC-MS/MS, and anti-FIIa as a surrogate of enoxaparin). The 
      highest effect on thrombin AUC (endogenous thrombin potential, or ETP), thrombin 
      (peak), thrombin generation lag time, and velocity index was observed for 
      EDOX+ENOX, followed by ENOX, ENOX12-EDOX, and EDOX. The greatest effect on 
      anti-FXa activity was observed for EDOX+ENOX, followed by ENOX12-EDOX. As 
      expected, neither edoxaban nor enoxaparin significantly altered the PK of the 
      other drug. There were no serious adverse events during the study. It is 
      concluded that a 60-mg dose of edoxaban can be safely administered 12 h following 
      enoxaparin 1 mg/kg.

TI  - Minimizing the Risk of Bleeding with NOACs in the Elderly.
PG  - 491-500
LID - 10.1007/s40266-016-0376-z [doi]
AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban have gained a lot of popularity as alternatives to warfarin for 
      anticoagulation in various clinical settings. However, there is conflicting 
      opinion regarding the absolute benefit of NOAC use in elderly patients. Low body 
      mass, altered body composition of fat and muscle, renal impairment and concurrent 
      presence of multiple comorbidities predispose elderly patients to many adverse 
      effects with NOACs that are typically not seen in younger patients. There have 
      been reports that NOAC use, in particular dabigatran, is associated with a higher 
      risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly. Diagnosis and management of 
      NOAC-associated bleeding in the elderly is difficult due to the absence of 
      commonly available drug-specific antidotes that can rapidly reverse the 
      anticoagulant effects. Moreover, in elderly patients, a number of factors such as 
      the presence of other comorbid medical conditions, renal insufficiency, drug 
      interactions from polypharmacy, risk of falls and dementia need to be considered 
      before prescribing anticoagulation therapy. Elderly patients frequently have 
      compromised renal function, and therefore dose adjustments according to 
      creatinine clearance for NOACs need to be made. As each NOAC comes with its own 
      unique advantages and safety profile, an individualized case by case approach 
      should be adopted to decide on the appropriate anticoagulation regimen for 
      elderly patients after weighing the overall risks and benefits of therapy.

TI  - Laboratory measurement of the anticoagulant activity of edoxaban: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 288-94
LID - 10.1007/s11239-015-1185-7 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban, an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa, was recently approved in the 
      United States and Japan for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). It is also licensed in Japan for prevention of VTE after 
      major orthopedic surgery. Although routine laboratory monitoring of edoxaban is 
      not required, laboratory measurement may be desirable in special circumstances. 
      Our objective was to provide a systematic review of current evidence on 
      laboratory measurement of the anticoagulant activity of edoxaban. PubMed and the 
      Cochrane Library were searched for studies that reported a relationship between 
      coagulation tests and plasma edoxaban levels. Study quality was assessed using 
      Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). We identified 9 
      eligible studies. Anti-Xa activity is linear across a broad range of drug levels 
      (R (2) > 0.95) and may be used for edoxaban quantification. The assay shows 
      greater variability at above on-therapy drug concentrations. The PT is less 
      sensitive to edoxaban. A normal prothrombin time may not exclude clinically 
      relevant on-therapy drug levels. The activated partial thromboplastin time has 
      insufficient sensitivity to edoxaban for measurement of its anticoagulant 
      activity. Edoxaban exhibits variable effects on coagulation assays. Understanding 
      these effects facilitates interpretation of test results in edoxaban-treated 
      patients. More data on the relationship between drug levels, coagulation test 
      results, and clinical outcomes in patients are needed.

AB  - Heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) used commonly are the standard treatment 
      of venous and arterial thromboses. They are very efficient and safe, but have 
      some limitations: iatrogenicity, laboratory monitoring, parenteral use for 
      heparins and fondaparinux. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used 
      orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as 
      efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The objective is to substitute 
      these indirect inhibitors of factor Xa (heparins, low molecular weight heparins 
      and fondaparinux) in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic 
      episodes. The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring 
      of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of 
      blood coagulation. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are efficacious and safe in the 
      prevention of cerebral infarcts in patients with non-valvular fibrillation. 
      Apixaban is another direct inhibitor of factor Xa used orally which is developed 
      in the same indications as rivaroxaban. Edoxaban and betrixaban are also in 
      development. The objective of this work is to study the pharmacodynamic, 
      pharmacokinetic, the efficacy and safety of these four oral direct factor Xa 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Sustained safe and effective anticoagulation using Edoxaban via percutaneous

LID - 10.1002/ehf2.12434 [doi]
AB  - Extensive data support the safety of direct oral anticoagulants compared with 
      vitamin K antagonists in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, leading 
      to a significantly increase in the use of these compounds in clinical practice. 
      However, there is no compelling evidence supporting the use of direct oral 
      anticoagulant in individuals who are intubated or have a percutaneous endoscopic 
      gastrostomy (PEG): patients with several co-morbidities are underrepresented in 
      clinical trials, so the best long-term strategy for anticoagulation is difficult 
      to ascertain. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the safety and 
      efficacy of edoxaban administered via PEG in a patient with heart failure and a 
      history of atrial fibrillation affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 
      71-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, advanced ALS, type II diabetes 
      mellitus, and hypertension presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea 
      and tachycardia. Because vitamin K antagonist and rivaroxaban 15 mg were dropped 
      because of difficult international normalized ratio control (time in therapeutic 
      range <30%) and severe haematuria, respectively, edoxaban 30 mg (crushed pill) 
      daily was administered based on the patient's weight of 58 kg. Mean edoxaban 
      plasma concentration-time profiles were measured, as anti-Xa activity, 2 h before 
      and at 2, 6, and 22 h after drug administration and then compared with the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of edoxaban 30 mg in healthy subjects. An additional 
      testing of steady-state peak plasma concentration of edoxaban after 10 days and a 
      30 day follow-up were evaluated. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      analysed with a non-compartmental analysis by PKSolver module, showed that C(max) 
      and AUC(0→t) were only slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects, 
      while the half-life and observed clearance were significantly longer and lower, 
      respectively, than in normal subjects. Steady-state peak plasma concentration of 
      edoxaban was very similar to the levels reported in healthy subjects, and neither 
      relevant bleeding nor thromboembolic event was reported at a 30 day follow-up. 
      These results support safe and effective anticoagulation with edoxaban 30 mg but 
      suggest caution with the use of full dose of edoxaban (60 mg daily) in this kind 
      of patients. We report, for the first time, a safe and effective anticoagulation 
      based on the administration of edoxaban 30 mg daily through PEG in a patient with 
      advanced ALS, acute respiratory, and heart failure, presenting with Takotsubo 
      syndrome and atrial fibrillation.

PG  - 319-330

AB  - Edoxaban is the last direct oral anticoagulant marketed for the prevention of 
      stroke among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Areas covered: 
      ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 was the pivotal clinical trial that led to the approval of 
      edoxaban 60 mg once daily. After the publication of this study, a great number of 
      substudies and post hoc analyses have been published, together with some 
      observational studies. The aim of this review was to update the current evidence 
      about the use of edoxaban in AF patients. Expert opinion: In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 
      48 trial, edoxaban 60 mg was noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke 
      or systemic embolism, but significantly reduced the risk of bleeding, major 
      adverse cardiac events and death from cardiovascular causes. The relative 
      efficacy and safety of edoxaban 60 mg compared with warfarin were independent of 
      different clinical conditions, such as prior stroke, age, risk of falls, renal 
      function, hepatic disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, valvular heart 
      disease, or cancer. Data about the effectiveness and safety of edoxaban in 
      real-life patients are scarce, but consistent with those of the pivotal clinical 
      trial. Edoxaban seems a cost-effective alternative to warfarin among AF patients 
      with moderate to high thromboembolic risk.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a 
      review of pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, quality of life, and cost 
      effectiveness.
PG  - 789-98
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S45644 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to be a leading cause of cerebrovascular 
      morbidity and mortality resulting from cardioembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulation 
      therapy has been shown to decrease the incidence of cardioembolic stroke in 
      patients with AF by more than 50%. Appropriate use of anticoagulation with 
      vitamin K antagonists requires precise adherence and monitoring. A number of 
      factors that potentially induce patients' dissatisfaction reduce quality of 
      patient life. New direct oral anticoagulants, such as the direct factor Xa 
      inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and the thrombin inhibitor 
      dabigatran, were developed to overcome the limitations of the conventional 
      anticoagulant drugs. However, models to optimize the benefit of therapy and to 
      ensure that therapy can be safely continued are missing for the new oral 
      anticoagulants. This review will briefly describe the new oral anticoagulants 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with focus on their use for 
      prevention of embolic events in AF. Moreover, it will discuss the safety, 
      efficacy, cost data, and benefit for patients' quality of life and adherence.

TI  - Dental management of patients taking novel oral anticoagulants (NOAs): 
      Dabigatran.
PG  - e289-e293
LID - 10.4317/jced.53219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A new group of oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban) with clear advantages over classic dicoumarin oral anticoagulants 
      (warfarin and acenocoumarol) has been developed in recent years. Patients being 
      treated with oral anticoagulants are at higher risk for bleeding when undergoing 
      dental treatments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted 
      through April 2016 for publications in the ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed and 
      Cochrane Library using the keywords "dabigatran", "rivaroxaban", "apixaban", 
      "edoxaban", "new oral anticoagulants", "novel oral anticoagulants", "bleeding" 
      and "dental treatment". RESULTS: There is no need for regular coagulation 
      monitoring of patients on dabigatran therapy. Whether or not to temporarily 
      discontinue dabigatran must be assessed according to the bleeding risk involved 
      in the dental procedure to be performed. CONCLUSIONS: The number of patients 
      under treatment with new oral anticoagulants will increase in the coming years. 
      It is essential to know about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new 
      oral anticoagulants and about their interactions with other drugs. It is 
      necessary to develop clinical guidelines for the perioperative and postoperative 
      management of these new oral anticoagulants in oral surgical procedures, and to 
      carefully evaluate the bleeding risk of dental treatment, as well as the 
      thrombotic risk of suppressing the new oral anticoagulant. Key words:Dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, novel oral anticoagulants, bleeding.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics of Novel Direct Oral Anticoagulants: Newly Identified Genes and 
      Genetic Variants.
LID - 10.3390/jpm9010007 [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have shown an upward prescribing trend in 
      recent years due to favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics without 
      requirement for routine coagulation monitoring. However, recent studies have 
      documented inter-individual variability in plasma drug levels of DOACs. 
      Pharmacogenomics of DOACs is a relatively new area of research. There is a need 
      to understand the role of pharmacogenomics in the interpatient variability of the 
      four most commonly prescribed DOACs, namely dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban. We performed an extensive search of recently published research 
      articles including clinical trials and in-vitro studies in PubMed, particularly 
      those focusing on genetic loci, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DNA 
      polymorphisms, and their effect on inter-individual variation of DOACs. 
      Additionally, we also focused on commonly associated drug-drug interactions of 
      DOACs. CES1 and ABCB1 SNPs are the most common documented genetic variants that 
      contribute to alteration in peak and trough levels of dabigatran with 
      demonstrated clinical impact. ABCB1 SNPs are implicated in alteration of plasma 
      drug levels of rivaroxaban and apixaban. Studies conducted with factor Xa, ABCB1, 
      SLCOB1, CYP2C9, and VKORC1 genetic variants did not reveal any significant 
      association with plasma drug levels of edoxaban. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
      interactions of dabigatran are mainly mediated by p-glycoprotein. Strong 
      inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein should be avoided in 
      patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. We conclude that some 
      of the inter-individual variability of DOACs can be attributed to alteration of 
      genetic variants of gene loci and drug-drug interactions. Future research should 
      be focused on exploring new genetic variants, their effect, and molecular 
      mechanisms that contribute to alteration of plasma levels of DOACs.

AB  - Direct (New-generation) Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as effective 
      agents which are used in place of vitamin-K antagonists in treatment and 
      prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), atrial fibrillation and other 
      thrombotic diseases. Among them, the FIIa- direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran 
      and FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are the most broadly used. 
      Anticoagulant dosing may differ under special considerations. The patients' 
      physiological reserves, organ functional status and failures should be taken into 
      account in clinical decision-making processes. The advantages and drawbacks of 
      each specific agent should be weighed with special regard to metabolism, 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, along with the efficiency of the agents in 
      different indications. This article aims to review the most recent literature to 
      highlight the usage and efficacy of the agents in different clinical conditions.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Response to Anticoagulation: A Review of the 
      Literature.
PG  - 685-693
LID - 10.1177/0897190019894142 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulants are among the most frequently prescribed medications 
      in the United States. Racial and ethnic disparities in incidence and outcomes of 
      thrombotic disorders are well-documented, but differences in response to 
      anticoagulation are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      review is to describe the impact of race and ethnicity on surrogate and clinical 
      end points related to anticoagulation and discuss racial or ethnic considerations 
      for prescribing anticoagulants. METHODS: A PubMed and MEDLINE search of clinical 
      trials published between 1950 and May 2018 was conducted using search terms 
      related to anticoagulation, specific anticoagulant drugs, race, and ethnicity. 
      References of identified studies were also reviewed. English-language human 
      studies on safety or efficacy of anticoagulants reporting data for different 
      races or ethnicities were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Seventeen relevant 
      studies were identified. The majority of major trials reviewed for inclusion 
      either did not include representative populations or did not report on the racial 
      breakdown of participants. Racial differences in pharmacokinetics, dosing 
      requirements, drug response, and/or safety end points were identified for 
      unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, argatroban, warfarin, rivaroxaban, and 
      edoxaban. CONCLUSIONS: Race appears to influence drug concentrations, dosing, or 
      safety for some but not all direct oral anticoagulants. This information should 
      be considered when selecting anticoagulant therapy for nonwhite individuals.

TI  - Apixaban versus edoxaban for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 367-76
LID - 10.2217/cer.15.15 [doi]
AB  - Oral anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay of stroke prevention in nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation patients. Vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin) have been 
      effective conventional oral anticoagulants for several decades. However, due to 
      their limitations in clinical use, several nonvitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) 
      have been developed. Nonetheless, no head to head trials have been performed to 
      directly compare these NOACs in patient cohorts. In this review article, two 
      direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and edoxaban, are briefly described with 
      focus on their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, plus drug 
      interactions. Moreover, both efficacy and safety will be discussed based on the 
      available data from the large Phase III clinical trials and indirect comparison 
      studies.

AB  - Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation- (NVAF-) related stroke and venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) are cardiovascular diseases associated with significant 
      morbidity and economic burden. The historical standard treatment of VTE has been 
      the administration of parenteral heparinoid until oral warfarin therapy attains a 
      therapeutic international normalized ratio. Warfarin has been the most common 
      medication for stroke prevention in NVAF. Warfarin use is complicated by a narrow 
      therapeutic window, unpredictable dose response, numerous food and drug 
      interactions, and requirements for frequent monitoring. To overcome these 
      disadvantages, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban-have been developed for the prevention of stroke or 
      systemic embolic events (SEE) in patients with NVAF and for the treatment of VTE. 
      Advantages of DOACs include predictable pharmacokinetics, few drug-drug 
      interactions, and low monitoring requirements. In clinical studies, DOACs are 
      noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of NVAF-related stroke and the 
      treatment and prevention of VTE as well as postoperative knee and hip surgery VTE 
      prophylaxis, with decreased bleeding risks. This review addresses the practical 
      considerations for the emergency physician in DOAC use, including dosing 
      recommendations, laboratory monitoring, anticoagulation reversal, and 
      cost-effectiveness. The challenges of DOACs, such as the lack of specific 
      laboratory measurements and antidotes, are also discussed.

AB  - Anticoagulants have exhibited a critical role in the prevention and/or treatment 
      of thrombotic diseases. Up to now, kinds of novel oral anticoagulants, inhibiting 
      plasma serine proteases in the coagulation cascade, have been developed to 
      overcome the clinical limitations of classical anticoagulants (like warfarin and 
      heparins). Some of them, such as Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, and Dabigatran, 
      have been approved by FDA in recent years. This review summarizes the discovery 
      and optimization of representative novel oral anticoagulants with the aim to 
      improve selectivity and bioavailability of compounds. The impact of different 
      targets in the cascade on bleeding risk also is discussed. We hope some more 
      effective, selective, and safer anticoagulants can be developed in the future on 
      the basis of these design experiences.

AB  - The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in the treatment 
      of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE). They have several advantages over vitamin-K antagonists such as warfarin, 
      including more predictable pharmacokinetics and improved safety, particularly 
      with fatal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. However, several issues remain 
      surrounding the use of NOACs in certain subpopulations and with the approach to 
      reversal. The periprocedural management of anticoagulation with these relatively 
      new agents can also present several challenges. This article reviews the basic 
      pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of these drugs. Several populations at higher 
      risk for complications with use of NOACs are discussed, including those 
      undergoing procedures. Finally, several target-specific reversal agents have 
      either received FDA approval or likely will be approved in the near future; these 
      agents and their roles in the approach to anticoagulation reversal will also be 
      discussed.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Uninterrupted Periprocedural Edoxaban in Patients 
      Undergoing Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation　- The Prospective KYU-RABLE 
      Study.
PG  - 2017-2024
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-19-0535 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The KYU-RABLE study, a prospective, multicenter, single-arm 
      interventional study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted oral 
      edoxaban in patients undergoing catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled patients with AF from 23 centers in Japan. 
      Edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg in patients indicated for dose adjustment) was administered 
      uninterrupted, once daily in the morning for ≥4 weeks before CA and 4 weeks ±7 
      days after CA with one dose delayed on the procedural day. The primary endpoint 
      was a composite of thromboembolism and major bleeding during 4 weeks from the 
      procedural day. Among the 513 eligible patients who underwent CA, 63.5% received 
      edoxaban 60 mg/day and 36.1% received 30 mg/day. For the primary endpoint, no 
      thromboembolism and 1 major bleeding event (0.2%, cardiac tamponade) were 
      observed. The plasma edoxaban concentration decreased depending on the time from 
      the last administration to the CA procedure. However, plasma levels of 
      coagulative biomarkers were within appropriate ranges regardless of the interval 
      from the last administration of edoxaban. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided 
      evidence of the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted edoxaban administered once 
      daily in the morning, with one dose delayed on procedural day, in patients with 
      AF undergoing CA. Edoxaban was associated with a low risk of periprocedural 
      thromboembolic and bleeding complications.

TI  - Choosing Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants: Practical Considerations 
      We Need to Know.
PG  - 531-541
AB  - BACKGROUND: Warfarin is a well-established agent for use in the prevention of 
      stroke or systemic embolic event (SEE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
      However, management of patients requiring oral anticoagulation with warfarin can 
      be complicated by the need for frequent monitoring, drug-drug and drug-food 
      interactions, and a variable response based on genetic polymorphisms. The 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were developed as 
      alternatives to warfarin; they do not require routine monitoring and have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics, fewer drug-drug interactions, and limited drug-food 
      interactions. Four NOACs-dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban-have 
      received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of 
      stroke or SEE in NVAF and for the treatment of VTE. Selecting the most 
      appropriate agent for each patient should be done in consideration of patient 
      preferences and characteristics, including renal function, bleeding risk, and the 
      need for other medications. METHODS: A search was performed on the terms atrial 
      fibrillation and venous thromboembolism with individual terms dabigatran, 
      apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban to identify relevant manuscripts; large 
      randomized clinical trials, metaanalyses, and treatment guideline recommendations 
      were given preference. Searches to identify registries, treatment guidelines, and 
      metaanalyses relevant to specific subgroups were also used. RESULTS: NOACs are 
      effective in reducing the risk of stroke or SEE in patients with NVAF and are 
      associated with fewer incidents of intracranial bleeding vs warfarin. CONCLUSION: 
      NOACs provide a convenient and safe alternative to warfarin and may result in 
      improved therapeutic outcomes for patients with NVAF or VTE. The use of NOACs in 
      other indications and patient populations is under investigation, and clinical 
      trials investigating their use in acute coronary syndrome, medically ill 
      patients, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardioversion, catheter ablation, 
      coronary arterial disease, and heart failure have been announced.

AB  - Obesity is an epidemic with rising prevalence, and obese patients are predisposed 
      to comorbid conditions that increase risk for thromboembolic events. It is 
      critical to identify safe and effective anticoagulation therapy for use in this 
      population. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a preferred option for 
      anticoagulation in patients of normal weight due to many benefits and equivalent 
      safety and efficacy to their vitamin K antagonist counterparts. However, the 
      safety and efficacy of DOACs in obese patients is not well understood. This 
      review describes recent studies on the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy, and 
      clinical outcomes of the DOACs apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and dabigatran in 
      obese patient populations. DOACs may be a beneficial alternative to vitamin K 
      antagonist therapy in obese patient populations.

OAB - The incidence of obesity within the USA is on the rise, as is that of the medical 
      conditions that often accompany it. These include conditions that can predispose 
      individuals to forming clots in the blood, such as atrial fibrillation, which is 
      a form of an abnormal heartbeat, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is 
      caused by fat buildup around the liver. Therefore, it is important that we have 
      effective medicines that can prevent clotting in an obese patient population. 
      Direct oral anticoagulants are a new, preferred medication option for this, but 
      it is unclear how safe or effective they are in obese people; there is some 
      concern that because of increased body weight, individuals may not get enough 
      medicine to effectively prevent clots from forming, which would ultimately put 
      them at risk for clotting and serious adverse health outcomes such as stroke. 
      This review describes recent studies on the use of the direct oral anticoagulants 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and dabigatran in obese patients, and whether 
      they are a safe and effective form of anticoagulation in this population.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban in Japanese Atrial Fibrillation Patients 
      With Severe Renal Impairment.
PG  - 484-491
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.329 [doi]
AB  - This is a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis to predict PK of edoxaban, 
      a direct-acting oral anticoagulant, in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
      patients with severe renal impairment (SRI; creatinine clearance [CL(cr) ] <30 
      mL/min). Data from a phase 3 study recently conducted in Japanese NVAF patients 
      (n = 90), including patients with SRI, were used to update the ENGAGE PopPK model 
      that had been developed based on pooled data from the phase 3 ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 
      study and 13 phase 1 PK studies, which included few patients with SRI. The final 
      model indicated that the ENGAGE PopPK model was applicable to Japanese patients 
      in that the model-simulated and study-observed concentration-time profiles were 
      in agreement. Estimated model parameters after the addition of Japanese SRI data 
      were consistent with those derived from the original ENGAGE PopPK data set. The 
      model-predicted exposure in NVAF patients with SRI who received edoxaban at a 
      15-mg, once-daily dose was similar to that in patients with normal renal function 
      or with mild renal impairment receiving a 30-mg dose. This suggests that efficacy 
      and safety data from the ENGAGE AF study can be used to support dose setting for 
      NVAF patients with SRI.

AB  - Aim: Dried blood spot (DBS) is a sampling approach that offers several advantages 
      over plasma and whole blood (WB) sampling, but several factors, such as 
      hematocrit and temperature, can adversely affect quantitation. Methodology & 
      results: In an open-label, three-way crossover study in healthy subjects, we 
      explored the correlation between DBS, WB and plasma samples, and between DBS 
      samples from finger-prick and venipuncture blood for measuring edoxaban and its 
      metabolite M-4 using LC-MS/MS. The methods were validated comprehensively. The 
      incurred sample reanalysis experiments demonstrated quantitation reproducibility 
      in all three matrices. Overall, there was a good correlation (near perfect 
      concordance for edoxaban) among plasma, WB and DBS measurements. M-4 
      concentrations in DBS and WB were lower than in plasma. Conclusion: These results 
      indicate using DBS may be used as an alternative methodology to measure edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Obesity: An Updated Literature Review.
PG  - 1144-1158
LID - 10.1177/1060028020923584 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review literature on the use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) in patients with high body weight (BW) and/or high body mass index (BMI) 
      and to make recommendations regarding use in this patient population. DATA 
      SOURCES: A search using PubMed was conducted (inception to April 13, 2020) using 
      the term DOAC AND the terms obesity OR body weight. A separate search was also 
      conducted with individual DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) and 
      the aforementioned terms. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies included 
      examined the effect of BW and/or BMI on DOAC pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or 
      safety. Included studies had DOAC indications of prevention of stroke in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, or treatment or long-term prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism. DATA SYNTHESIS: The efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients 
      with high BW/BMI has not yet been elucidated by randomized trials; however, 2016 
      international guidelines suggest avoiding their use in patients with a BW >120 kg 
      or BMI >40 kg/m(2). Since 2016, several studies have been published examining use 
      of DOACs in this patient population. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: This review thoroughly discusses the literature on DOACs in patients 
      with a BW >120 kg or BMI >40 kg/m(2) pre-2016 and post-2016 guidelines. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that each DOAC may have differences in outcomes 
      when used in patients with a high BW/BMI. Currently, low-quality data are 
      available that support avoiding dabigatran and considering apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban; lack of sufficient data preclude a recommendation for edoxaban use 
      in this patient population.

PG  - 753-61
LID - 10.1358/dot.2011.47.10.1709241 [doi]
AB  - Without thromboprophylaxis, hospital-acquired deep vein thrombosis following 
      major orthopedic surgery occurs with an incidence of approximately 40-60%, which 
      is why thromboprophylaxis has been standard of care in these cases for more than 
      20 years. Edoxaban (DU-176b; Lixiana) is a novel, once-daily, orally active 
      antithrombotic agent that directly inhibits factor Xa activity in a potent and 
      selective way. It was recently approved in Japan for the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism after total knee replacement, total hip replacement and hip 
      fracture surgery. In phase III trials performed in patients eligible for total 
      knee replacement or total hip replacement, edoxaban 30 mg demonstrated a 
      statistically significant reduction in venous thromboembolic events compared with 
      enoxaparin, with no difference between both treatments in the incidence of major 
      bleeding events. Edoxaban is safe and well tolerated, with predictable 
      pharmacokinetics (low intersubject variability and low protein binding), 
      suggesting that coagulation monitoring may not be required.

TI  - Methods to Correct Drug-Induced Coagulopathy in Bleeding Emergencies: A 
      Comparative Review.
PG  - 336-343
LID - 10.1093/labmed/lmab115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy have become increasingly 
      popular. The goal of therapy is to prevent venous thromboembolism and platelet 
      aggregation, respectively. Traditional anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs are 
      quickly being replaced with novel medications with more predictable 
      pharmacokinetics. Unfortunately, these drugs carry the risk of uncontrolled 
      hemorrhage because of drug-induced coagulopathy. Uncontrolled hemorrhage 
      continues to be a major cause of preventable death: hemorrhage accounts for 
      approximately 30% of trauma-related deaths, second to brain injury. Controlling 
      hemorrhage while dealing with comorbidities remains a challenge to clinicians. 
      There are many gaps in care and knowledge that contribute to the struggle of 
      treating this patient population. METHODS: This literature review is focused on 
      the most effective ways to achieve hemostasis in a patient with drug-induced 
      coagulopathy. The antiplatelet therapies aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, 
      pasugrel, and ticagrelor are analyzed. Anticoagulant therapies are also reviewed, 
      including warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran. In addition, 
      viscoelastic testing and platelet function assays are reviewed for their ability 
      to monitor drug effectiveness and to accurately depict the patient's ability to 
      clot. This review focuses on articles from the past 10 years. However, there are 
      limitations to the 10-year restriction, including no new research posted within 
      the 10-year timeline on particular subjects. The most recent article was then 
      used where current literature did not exist (within 10 years). RESULTS: 
      Traditional anticoagulants have unpredictable pharmacokinetics and can be 
      difficult to correct in bleeding emergencies. Vitamin K has been proven to 
      reliably and effectively reverse the effect of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) while 
      having a lower anaphylactoid risk than frozen plasma. Prothrombin complex 
      concentrates should be used when there is risk of loss of life or limb. Frozen 
      plasma is not recommended as a first-line treatment for the reversal of VKAs. 
      Novel anticoagulants have specific reversal agents such as idarucizumab for 
      dabigatran and andexxa alfa for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors. Although reliable, 
      these drugs carry a large price tag. As with traditional anticoagulants, cheaper 
      alternative therapies are available such as prothrombin complex concentrates. 
      Finally, static coagulation testing works well for routine therapeutic drug 
      monitoring but may not be appropriate during bleeding emergencies. Viscoelastic 
      testing such as thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry depict in 
      vivo hemostatic properties more accurately than static coagulation assays. Adding 
      viscoelastic testing into resuscitation protocols may guide blood product usage 
      more efficiently. CONCLUSION: This review is intended to be used as a guide. The 
      topics covered in this review should be used as a reference for treating the 
      conditions described. This review article also covers laboratory testing and is 
      meant as a guide for physicians on best practices. These findings illustrate 
      recommended testing and reversal techniques based off evidence-based medicine and 
      literature.

PG  - 124
LID - 10.1007/s11886-017-0930-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to offer practical management 
      strategies for when patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants require 
      elective surgery or present with bleeding complications. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Clinical practice guidelines are now available on the timing of periprocedural 
      interruption of treatment with the newer direct oral anticoagulants based on 
      their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and based on findings from cohort 
      studies and clinical trials. An antibody that reverses the effects of dabigatran 
      is now available, and a factor Xa decoy is being developed as an antidote to 
      apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The timing of interruption of 
      direct oral anticoagulants for elective surgery is based on multiple factors, 
      including pharmacologic properties and interactions, the patient's renal 
      function, and the type of planned surgery. There is little role for 
      low-molecular-weight heparin bridging. Idarucizumab is the treatment of choice 
      for dabigatran-related life-threatening bleeding, while andexanet alfa is being 
      developed to reverse factor Xa inhibitors.

PG  - 1445-1461
AB  - The approval of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as antithrombotic 
      alternatives to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) has changed clinical practice. 
      However, the efficacy and safety of the four most commonly used NOACs 
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) might be compromised by 
      co-administration of other medications used for various major comorbidities. Dose 
      adjustment of the NOACs may be needed to avert cases of concomitant medication 
      affecting NOACs absorption, metabolism and coagulation. Areas covered: This 
      review summarizes the current knowledge regarding drug-drug interactions of NOACs 
      in order to guide health professionals regarding the dose modification required 
      if the NOACs are co-administered with other medication with potential significant 
      interactions. The data were acquired from searches of PubMed and also from the 
      NOAC reports to the European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration 
      Agency. Expert opinion: Most of the studies in this field have been organized by 
      pharmaceutical companies. Independent research and registries will provide more 
      information in the near future about the drug-drug interactions of NOACs. 
      P-glycoprotein transporter and cytochrome P450 enzyme complexes appear to be the 
      main pathways where the most drug-drug interactions with NOACs occur.

TI  - Drug and dietary interactions of warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants: an 
      update.
PG  - 326-43
LID - 10.1007/s11239-011-0561-1 [doi]
AB  - Clinicians and patients around the world have been intrigued by the concept of 
      developing an oral anticoagulant with a broad therapeutic window and few drug and 
      dietary interactions that can be administered at fixed doses with no or minimal 
      monitoring. The recently approved oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, 
      along with the emerging oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban, have been developed to address many of the shortcomings of warfarin 
      therapy. As warfarin is associated with extensive food and drug interactions, 
      there is also a need to consider such interactions with the new oral 
      anticoagulants. While to date few drug and dietary interactions have been 
      reported with the new oral anticoagulants, it is still early in their development 
      and clinical use cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles will have to 
      be closely accounted for when determining the likelihood of a potential drug 
      interaction prior to therapy initiation. As the list of drugs and supplements 
      that interact with warfarin is continuously expanding, and the knowledge on drug 
      interactions with the novel oral anticoagulants is still in its infancy, 
      clinicians need to be vigilant when initiating any of these agents or when any 
      changes in the patient's medication profile occur and perform a close screening 
      for potential drug and dietary interactions. The objective of this paper is to 
      give an update on drug and dietary interactions with warfarin and the novel oral 
      anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of anticoagulant edoxaban in overdose in a Japanese patient 
      transported to hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticoagulant edoxaban is used clinically at doses of 
      30-60 mg/day; however, we experienced a patient who had taken an overdose of 
      edoxaban of 750 mg. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban in this 
      patient by using liquid chromatography-tandem spectrometry to estimate the 
      follow-up period in emergency clinical practice with this medicine. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: The patient was a 57-year-old woman (body weight, 69 kg) who had 
      taken a single oral dose of 750 mg of edoxaban in a suicide attempt. She was 
      emergently admitted to Kyoto Medical Center. The patient's edoxaban plasma 
      concentrations during ambulance transport (8 h after oral administration) 
      were ~ 4900 ng/ml, and the concentration gradually decreased to ~ 10 ng/mL and to 
      detectable but unmeasurable levels of ~ 1.0 ng/mL at 60 h and 100 h, 
      respectively. The linear range of the relationship between the dose and plasma 
      concentration was assumed to have been exceeded during the first 8 h; however, 
      the measured elimination rate of edoxaban was similar to that visualized curves 
      predicted by a simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic model previously 
      established. CONCLUSION: Simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic models 
      for creating visualized curves have proven to be useful not only during drug 
      discovery or chemical risk assessment but also in cases of medical poisoning. We 
      used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model previously established for 
      edoxaban to predict the pharmacokinetics in the current case. It is hoped that 
      the results of this study, which encompass drug monitoring data in the patient 
      and visualized pharmacokinetic prediction, will serve as an index when setting 
      the treatment and follow-up period in cases of drug overdose for medicines such 
      as edoxaban in emergency clinical practice.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Concurrent use of traditional herbal medicines 
      and conventional drugs, particularly for stroke treatment, is widespread, raising 
      concerns about potential drug interactions. AIM OF THE STUDY: This clinical study 
      aimed to investigate interactions between edoxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, 
      and two traditional herbal medicines commonly used for stroke: 
      Banhabaekchulcheonmatang (BBCT) and Hwangryeonhaedoktang (HRHDT). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Korean healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, open-label, 
      three-period, three-treatment, two-sequence clinical study. Treatments consisted 
      of a single oral dose of edoxaban tablet (60 mg) in the presence or absence of 
      multiple doses of BBCT or HRHDT three times daily for six days. Pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic parameters of edoxaban and its active metabolite M4 were 
      assessed following administration of edoxaban alone or in co-administration with 
      BBCT or HRHDT. RESULTS: When edoxaban was co-administered with BBCT or HRHDT, the 
      area under the curve (AUC) of edoxaban remained unaffected. However, its peak 
      concentrations (C(max)) were decreased by 18.5%-28.1%. Similarly, 
      co-administration of edoxaban with BBCT or HRHDT slightly decreased the AUC of M4 
      and reduced its C(max) by 16.8%-27.1%. Results revealed that BBCT and HRHDT had a 
      minor impact on pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and M4. Despite alterations in 
      systemic exposures, all pharmacodynamic parameters of edoxaban derived from 
      activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were equivalent 
      irrespective of herbal medicine co-administration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      contribute to our understanding of potential interactions between conventional 
      anticoagulants and traditional herbal medicines, highlighting the need for 
      comprehensive evaluation in clinical practice.

TI  - Evaluation of Drug-Drug Interactions Between Clarithromycin and Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants Using Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16111449 [doi]
LID - 1449
AB  - Objective: This study assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between 
      clarithromycin (a P-glycoprotein [P-gp] inhibitor) and four direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) (P-gp substrates) using physiologically based PK (PBPK) 
      models to elucidate the influence of P-gp in the interaction between them. 
      Methods: PBPK models for clarithromycin, DABE-dabigatran (DAB), rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban were constructed using GastroPlus™ (version 9.9), based on 
      physicochemical data and PK parameters from the literature. The models were 
      optimized and validated in healthy subjects. We evaluated the predictive 
      performance of the established model and further assessed the impact of P-gp on 
      the PK of the four DOACs. Successfully validated models were then used to 
      evaluate potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between clarithromycin and the 
      DOACs. Results: The established PBPK models accurately described the PK of 
      clarithromycin, DABE-DAB, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. The predicted PK 
      parameters (C(max), T(max), AUC(0-t)) were within 0.5-2 times the observed 
      values. A sensitivity analysis of P-gp parameters indicated that an increase in 
      P-gp expression was reduced by in vivo exposure to DOACs. The models demonstrated 
      good predictive ability for DDIs between clarithromycin and the anticoagulants, 
      and the ratio of the predicted values to the observed values of C(max) and the 
      area under the curve (AUC) in the DDI state was within the range of 0.5-2. 
      Conclusions: Comprehensive PBPK models for clarithromycin, DABE-DAB, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban were developed, which can effectively predict DDIs 
      mediated by P-gp's function. These models provide theoretical support for 
      clinical dose adjustments and serve as a foundation for future PBPK model 
      development for DOACs under specific pathological conditions.

PG  - 278-86
LID - 10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00209.x [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly occurring arrhythmia, and is a 
      condition of both significant clinical and economic importance. An antithrombotic 
      agent is considered mandatory as part of the management in most patients with AF. 
      It has been conclusively demonstrated that long-term anticoagulation therapy can 
      significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. While 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin are highly effective, they possess 
      numerous limitations that curtail their use, or make their use challenging for 
      clinicians and patients. A new generation of anticoagulants are being 
      investigated in phase III clinical trials in patients with AF. One or more of 
      these agents have the potential to either replace or act as alternatives to VKA 
      therapy in AF. This group includes the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, the 
      direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, and finally, the 
      vitamin K analogue, tecarfarin. Additional agents are being developed in phase I 
      or II clinical trials. The direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors are generally 
      small, synthetic molecules with predictable pharmacokinetics, a predictable 
      pharmacodynamic effect, few drug interactions and do not require routine 
      therapeutic drug monitoring. These new anticoagulants may well represent a new 
      era in anticoagulation. However, they do possess their own limitations and will 
      present new challenges for clinicians.

TI  - Evaluating pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions of direct oral anticoagulants 
      in patients with renal dysfunction.
PG  - 189-202
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2022.2074397 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug transporters, metabolic enzymes, and renal clearance play 
      significant roles in the pharmacokinetics of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). 
      Recommendations for DOAC drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by the product labeling 
      are limited to selected CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors and lack 
      considerations for concomitant renal dysfunction. AREAS COVERED: This review 
      focuses on: 1) current recommendations for the management of pharmacokinetic DOAC 
      DDIs and the evidence used to support them; 2) alterations in DOAC exposure in 
      the setting of concomitant DDIs and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment; 
      3) clinical outcomes associated with this combination; and 4) expert 
      recommendations for the management of pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs. 
      English-language, full-text articles on apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      edoxaban with a publication date up to 30 September 2021 were retrieved from 
      PubMed. EXPERT OPINION: Given the lack of supporting clinical data, empiric dose 
      adjustments based on pharmacokinetic data alone should be avoided. When a 
      considerable increase in a DOAC exposure is anticipated, it may be advisable to 
      use an alternative DOAC or anticoagulant from a different class. Future research 
      on identification of DOAC therapeutic ranges and target patient populations is 
      needed to inform clinical utility of DOAC level monitoring to guide the 
      management of DDIs.

LID - 10.1159/000447530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are nonvitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) approved for stroke prevention in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Phase-3 clinical trials demonstrated 
      NOACs were as effective as warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic 
      embolism and associated with decreased incidences of intracranial bleeding. 
      Additionally, NOACs provide quicker onset of action, simpler dosing, more 
      predictable pharmacokinetic profiles, and decreased food and drug interactions 
      compared with warfarin. Despite the advantages of NOACs, the lack of knowledge 
      may limit their use in clinical practice. METHODS: A search was performed on the 
      terms 'atrial fibrillation' and 'dabigatran', 'apixaban', 'edoxaban', or 
      'rivaroxaban' to identify relevant papers; large randomized clinical trials, 
      meta-analyses, and treatment guideline recommendations were given preference. 
      Searches to identify registries, treatment guidelines, and meta-analyses relevant 
      to patient subgroups were also employed. RESULTS: Dosing recommendations, 
      initiation of treatment, and applications in patients who undergo NVAF 
      procedures, have mechanical heart valves, or experience other cardiovascular 
      conditions such as myocardial infarction, previous stroke, and valvular heart 
      disease are summarized. The NOAC-specific reversal approaches are also discussed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Several important factors should be considered regarding the 
      adequate use of NOACs, especially in patients with renal impairment or 
      cardiovascular conditions other than NVAF.

TI  - The current landscape of treatment options for venous thromboembolism: a focus on 
      novel oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 197-210
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2014.975786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
      and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and 
      healthcare expenditure. Anticoagulant therapy is recommended for at least 3 
      months in patients with acute VTE to prevent recurrence. Conventional 
      anticoagulants are associated with inherent limitations including route of 
      administration, required monitoring and dose adjustments, potential for food-drug 
      and drug-drug interactions, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      and possible severe adverse events. SCOPE: This manuscript reviews the 
      pharmacology of the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and analyzes the 
      differences in phase 3 clinical trial designs, outcomes, and specific patient 
      populations investigated for the treatment of acute and prevention of secondary 
      VTE. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed using the key words 
      dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and venous thromboembolism in 
      PubMed. The search included all years, English language, and peer-reviewed 
      articles relating to phase 3 clinical trials, subanalyses, and meta-analyses of 
      these NOACs for the treatment of acute VTE and secondary prevention. FINDINGS: 
      NOACs have demonstrated comparable efficacy and comparable or superior safety in 
      large, randomized clinical trials in the treatment and prevention of VTE compared 
      with conventional therapy. New oral anticoagulants, including the direct thrombin 
      (dabigatran etexilate) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban), have advantages over conventional agents such as oral 
      administration at fixed doses, predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      minimal potential for food-drug and drug-drug interactions, and lack of required 
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: NOACs offer additional oral anticoagulation treatment 
      options for patients with VTE.

TI  - Current and Emerging Direct Oral Anticoagulants: State-of-the-Art.
PG  - 490-501
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1692703 [doi]
AB  - Anticoagulant drugs comprise a specific subcategory of antithrombotic agents that 
      act to inhibit blood coagulation at various stages, reducing clot development and 
      ultimately lowering the risk of developing new-onset or recurrent thrombosis. 
      Although the long history of anticoagulant drugs has been characteristically 
      shaped by coumarin and heparin derivatives, a new generation of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs), which specifically inhibit thrombin or activated factor 
      X, combine many advantages of their progenitor drugs, and hence are prepotently 
      revolutionizing the landscape of antithrombotic therapy. Several drugs (apixaban 
      [BMS-562247], dabigatran [BIBR953], edoxaban [DU-1766], rivaroxaban [BAY 
      59-7939]) have already received widespread approval by national or supranational 
      medicinal agencies. This narrative article provides a state-of-the-art for these 
      and for several other DOACs at different stages of clinical evaluation 
      (betrixaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, letaxaban, nokxaban), and certain others 
      whose development has been discontinued (AZD-0837, fidexaban, LY517717, 
      odiparcil, otamixaban, TTP889, and ximelagatran). What clearly emerges from our 
      analysis is that DOACs sharing very similar mechanisms of action are still 
      characterized by different efficacy and safety profiles. This not only depends on 
      biochemical, biological, and pharmacokinetic characteristics, but also on lack of 
      standardization between different clinical trials in terms of targeted disease, 
      patient recruitment, sample size, duration and endpoints, as well as lack of 
      harmonization around procedures used for drug licensing. These factors contribute 
      to challenging the minds of physicians, who may find difficulty navigating their 
      way through multiple indications, different pharmacological profiles, various 
      side effects, and specific drug-to-drug interactions. Such considerations also 
      burden laboratory professionals, who may face organizational and economic 
      challenges in developing and/or implementing multiple assays to assess the 
      pharmacodynamics (effect on coagulation) or pharmacokinetics (drug levels) of 
      DOACs.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent, potentially fatal health problem. 
      Although standard anticoagulant therapy is effective when compared with the newer 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), it has disadvantages. Heparin and its 
      derivatives must be administered parenterally, whereas use of oral vitamin K 
      antagonists is complicated by unpredictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, drug-food and drug-drug interactions and the requirement for 
      frequent laboratory monitoring. Randomized phase 3 trials have demonstrated that 
      patients receive similarly effective anticoagulation with the DOACs dabigatran, 
      edoxaban, rivaroxaban and apixaban when compared with warfarin, with similar or 
      reduced risk of bleeding. Extended therapy trials have consistently demonstrated 
      superior effectiveness for DOAC treatment when compared with placebo in 
      preventing VTE recurrence. This article presents a comprehensive review of the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and accumulated clinical trial evidence for 
      each DOAC for short-term, long-term and extended VTE therapy, and it considers 
      the potential implications these agents have for the clinical management of VTE.

TI  - Oral anticoagulant monitoring: Are we on the right track?
PG  - 40-48

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) cannot be administered without regular monitoring in 
      order to assure their efficacy and safety. Indeed, if well managed, the VKAs 
      appear to be no less efficacious or safe than the newer direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs). Although it is claimed that no regular monitoring of the 
      DOACs is needed, their levels are increasingly being measured under a variety of 
      circumstances, for example, prior to surgery, in suspected overdose, to confirm 
      effective reversal, in patients with malabsorption and to assess patient 
      compliance. Although no therapeutic range has been identified for the DOACs, it 
      has been demonstrated for dabigatran and edoxaban that their antithrombotic 
      effect increases gradually with increasing concentrations and that the risk of 
      major bleeding also gradually increases. Furthermore, it has been determined that 
      almost all dabigatran-related thrombotic events occur in patients with the lowest 
      quartile concentration of the drug. This suggests that to assure an ideal effect 
      of DOACs in all patients taking them, some form of regular monitoring and dose 
      tailoring should be performed. For the vitamin K antagonists, the best outcome is 
      obtained using formal algorithms and centralized management. Furthermore, data 
      suggest that replacing the standard prothrombin time as a monitoring test may 
      increase the stability of VKA anticoagulation with consequent reduction in 
      thromboembolism without an increase in bleeding. Thus, it is likely that the 
      outcome of all current oral anticoagulants can be improved in the coming years by 
      improving monitoring and tailoring their effect.

LID - 1067
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), namely apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban are being increasingly prescribed among the general population, as 
      they are considered to be associated to lower bleeding risk than classical 
      anticoagulants, and do not require coagulation monitoring. Likewise, DOACs are 
      increasingly concomitantly prescribed in patients with epilepsy taking, 
      therefore, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), above all among the elderly. As a result, 
      potential interactions may cause an increased risk of DOAC-related bleeding or a 
      reduced antithrombotic efficacy. The objective of the present review is to 
      describe the pharmacokinetic interactions between AEDs and DOACs of clinical 
      relevance. We observed that there are only few clinical reports in which such 
      interactions have been described in patients. More data are available on the 
      pharmacokinetics of both drugs classes which allow speculating on their potential 
      interactions. Older AEDs, acting on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, and especially on 
      CYP3A4, such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine are more likely to 
      significantly reduce the anticoagulant effect of DOACs (especially rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban). Newer AEDs not affecting significantly CYP or P-gp, such 
      as lamotrigine, or pregabalin are not likely to affect DOACs efficacy. Zonisamide 
      and lacosamide, which do not affect significantly CYP activity in vitro, might 
      have a quite safe profile, even though their effects on P-gp are not well-known, 
      yet. Levetiracetam exerts only a potential effect on P-gp activity, and thus it 
      might be safe, as well. In conclusion, there are only few case reports and 
      limited evidence on interactions between DOACs and AEDs in patients. However, the 
      overall evidence suggests that the interaction between these drug classes might 
      be of high clinical relevance and therefore further studies in larger patients' 
      cohorts are warranted for the future in order to better clarify their 
      pharmacokinetic and define the most appropriate clinical behavior.

AB  - Oral anticoagulation therapy is transforming with the advent of the target 
      specific oral anticoagulants, particularly, the direct thrombin inhibitors and 
      factor Xa inhibitors. These agents have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety 
      and offer several potential advantages over current standard of care therapy, 
      warfarin. Nevertheless, the pharmacology between the newly approved oral 
      anticoagulants differs and must be considered for appropriate management and 
      patient selection. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of dabigatran 
      etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are discussed in detail, which may 
      translate into considerable clinical implications.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of a standard 
      high-fat meal on the single-dose (60 mg) pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban in 
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian male volunteers matched by body mass index. This 
      was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study. All 32 enrolled 
      volunteers completed the study per protocol. Both serial blood and urine samples 
      were collected, and edoxaban concentrations were analyzed by a validated liquid 
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. Activated partial thromboplastin 
      and prothrombin times were obtained as measures of pharmacodynamic effect. The 
      point estimates of the geometric mean ratios (fed/fasted) for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), 
      and C(max) demonstrated modest increases ranging from 6% to 22% across PK 
      parameters for both race cohorts. The disposition was similar in both Japanese 
      and Caucasian matched volunteers with slightly higher AUC values (ranging from 
      7%-9%) in Caucasians. There were no serious adverse events during the study. All 
      drug-related adverse events were mild and self-limited, and none were bleeding 
      related. Both Japanese and Caucasian volunteers demonstrated a modest but 
      clinically insignificant food effect. It was concluded that edoxaban can be 
      administered without regard to food.

      Clinicians Need to Know.
PG  - 236-248
LID - 10.1002/phar.1884 [doi]
AB  - The direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban, have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties and equal or superior efficacy and an improved safety profile compared 
      with warfarin. Noted shortcomings with DOACs are shorter half-lives requiring 
      stricter adherence, lack of standardized laboratory monitoring, lack of 
      anticoagulation reversal agents, and loss of routine coagulation monitoring 
      leading to fewer patient-clinician interactions. This review addresses many of 
      these limitations including monitoring of DOACs for efficacy and toxicity, an 
      assessment of selected qualitative and quantitative tests, and development of 
      monitoring strategies for special populations. Coagulation monitoring is 
      generally recommended only in overdose situations, but once standardized assays 
      are readily available, they could be helpful to ensure efficacy, assess bleeding, 
      and aid in drug selection in a number of other patient scenarios. Coagulation 
      tests that may provide qualitative assessment include activated partial 
      thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and thrombin time. Methods with potential 
      utility for quantitative assessment of DOACs include plasma drug concentrations, 
      ecarin clotting time, dilute thrombin time, and anti-factor Xa concentrations. 
      Noncoagulation laboratory monitoring should include serum creatinine, liver 
      function tests, and complete blood counts. Clinical monitoring of the 
      DOAC-treated patient should include routine assessment of adherence, bleeding 
      risks, and drug interactions. Frequency of monitoring should be 1-3 months after 
      initiation and then at least every 6 months, with more frequent follow-up (i.e., 
      3 months) based on patient specific characteristics such as age, renal 
      impairment, hepatic impairment, and concomitant drug therapy. The authors provide 
      a practical tool to assist in DOAC monitoring and recommend that pharmacists 
      collaborate with physicians in selecting appropriate patients and tailoring 
      patient-specific monitoring plans.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a more manageable alternative than vitamin 
      K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation and to prevent and treat venous thromboembolism. Despite their 
      widespread use in clinical practice, there are still some unresolved issues on 
      optimizing their use in particular clinical settings. Herein, we reviewed the 
      current clinical evidence on uses of DOACs from pharmacology and clinical 
      indications to safety and practical issues such as drugs and food interactions. 
      Dabigatran is the DOAC most affected by interactions with drugs and food, 
      although all DOACs demonstrate a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Management 
      issues associated with perioperative procedures, bleeding treatment, and special 
      populations (pregnancy, renal and hepatic impairment, elderly, and oncologic 
      patients) have been discussed. Literature evidence shows that DOACs are at least 
      as effective as VKAs, with a favorable safety profile; data are particularly 
      encouraging in using low doses of edoxaban in elderly patients, and edoxaban and 
      rivaroxaban in the treatment of venous thromboembolism in oncologic patients. In 
      the next year, DOAC clinical indications are likely to be further extended.

AB  - Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor that has been 
      evaluated for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence. 
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and logistic regression 
      analyses were used to explore the clinical data from phase 1 and 2 studies to 
      determine the relationship among PK exposure, PD response, and bleeding risk. 
      Population PK/PD modeling was performed using plasma edoxaban concentration data 
      from combined phase 1 and 2 studies and using intrinsic FXa data from a phase 2 
      AF study. A 2-compartment PK model adequately described the combined PK data, and 
      a dynamic binding model characterized the dynamics of the intrinsic factor X 
      activity (iFXa) data. Logistic regression analysis then identified the 
      relationship between the iFXa and the observed bleeding risk. The more protracted 
      suppression of FXa over the dosing interval for a 30-mg twice-daily dose compared 
      with a 60-mg once-daily dose offers an explanation for the significantly higher 
      bleeding rate at the former dose.

TI  - Handling delayed or missed direct oral anticoagulant doses: model-informed 
      individual remedial dosing.
PG  - 5906-5916
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2024013854 [doi]
AB  - Nonadherence to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) pharmacotherapy may increase the 
      risk of thromboembolism or bleeding, and delayed or missed doses are the most 
      common types of nonadherence. Current recommendations from regulatory agencies or 
      guidelines regarding this issue lack evidence and fail to consider individual 
      differences. This study aimed to develop individual remedial dosing strategies 
      when the dose was delayed or missed for DOACs, including rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      edoxaban, and dabigatran etexilate. Remedial dosing regimens based on population 
      pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulation strategies were 
      developed to expeditiously restore drug concentration or PD biomarkers within the 
      therapeutic range. Population PK-PD characteristics of DOACs were retrieved from 
      previously published literature. The effects of factors that influence PK and PD 
      parameters were assessed for their impact on remedial dosing regimens. A 
      web-based dashboard was established with R-shiny to recommend remedial dosing 
      regimens based on patient traits, dosing schedules, and delay duration. 
      Addressing delayed or missed doses relies on the delay time and specific DOACs 
      involved. Additionally, age, body weight, renal function, and polypharmacy may 
      marginally affect remedial strategies. The proposed remedial dosing strategies 
      surpass current recommendations, with less deviation time beyond the therapeutic 
      range. The online dashboard offers quick and convenient solutions for addressing 
      missed or delayed DOACs, enabling individualized remedial dosing strategies based 
      on patient characteristics to mitigate the risks of bleeding and thrombosis.

TI  - New Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) and Their Use Today.
LID - 10.3390/dj4010005 [doi]
LID - 5
AB  - The ideal anticoagulant is oral, has a wide therapeutic range, predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a rapid onset of action, an available 
      antidote, minimal side effects and minimal interactions with other drugs or food. 
      With the development of the novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), we now have 
      an alternative to the traditional vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for the prevention 
      and treatment of thrombosis. DOACs have limited monitoring requirements and very 
      predictable pharmacokinetic profiles. They were shown to be non-inferior or 
      superior to VKA in the prophylaxis or treatment of thromboembolic events. 
      Particularly in terms of safety they were associated with less major bleeding, 
      including intracranial bleeding, thus providing a superior benefit for the 
      prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite these 
      advantages, there are remaining limitations with DOACs: their dependence on renal 
      and hepatic function for clearance and the lack of an approved reversal agent, 
      whereas such antidotes are successively being made available. DOACs do not need 
      regular monitoring to assess the treatment effect but, on the other hand, they 
      interact with other drugs and interfere with functional coagulation assays. From 
      a practical point of view, the properties of oral administration, simple dosing 
      without monitoring, a short half-life allowing for the possibility of 
      uncomplicated switching or bridging, and proven safety overwhelm the 
      disadvantages, making them an attractive option for short- or long-term 
      anticoagulation.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The prevalence 
      of AF in persons older than 55 years is at least 33.5 million globally and is 
      predicted to more than double in the next half-century. Anticoagulation, heart 
      rate control, and heart rhythm control comprise the 3 main treatment strategies 
      in AF. Anticoagulation is aimed at preventing debilitating stroke, systemic 
      embolism, and associated mortality. Historically, anticoagulation in AF was 
      achieved with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, which is supported by 
      evidence demonstrating reduced incident stroke and all-cause mortality. However, 
      warfarin has unpredictable pharmacokinetics with many drug-drug interactions that 
      require regular monitoring to ensure patients remain in the therapeutic 
      anticoagulant range. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants including 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban provide a possible solution to 
      these issues with their more predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, 
      and greater specificity. Results from large randomized, controlled trials 
      indicate that these agents are at least noninferior to warfarin in prevention of 
      stroke. These trials also demonstrate a consistently lower incidence of 
      intracranial hemorrhage, almost always all life-threatening bleeds, and many 
      forms of major bleeds with the possible exception of gastrointestinal and some 
      other forms of mucosal bleeding, compared with warfarin. Patients with AF are a 
      heterogeneous population with diverse risk of stroke and bleeding, and different 
      subgroups respond differently to anticoagulation. Important clinical questions 
      have arisen regarding optimal anticoagulation drug selection in distinct 
      populations such as those with renal impairment, older age, coronary artery 
      disease, and heart failure as well as those at particularly high risk for 
      bleeding or thromboembolism. In this review, treatment strategies in AF 
      management are discussed in the context of different individual subgroups of 
      patients.

AB  - Recent findings require an update of previous recommendations for the 
      perioperative use of Direct Oral AntiCoagulants (DOACs). A break in preoperative 
      treatment of 24-96 hours is recommended based on the pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      DOACs and depends on individual patient characteristics, their renal and possibly 
      liver function, and their surgery-related risk of bleeding. In cases of renal or 
      hepatic insufficiency, whether to extend the preoperative interruption of IIa- 
      and Xa-inhibitors is a clinical decision that must be reached on an individual 
      patient basis. In cases of epidural or spinal anaesthesia, more conservative 
      pausing-intervals are recommended due to the risk of persistent neurologic 
      deficits (e.g., paraplegia) following the development of spinal subdural and 
      epidural haematomas. Elective surgery should be postponed according to these 
      recommendations. Preoperative "bridging" with LMWH (more precisely referred to as 
      "switching") should be omitted due to a significantly increased risk of bleeding. 
      In addition, the incidence of perioperative thromboembolic risks, such as DVT, 
      PE, and stroke, are no different whether interruption or "switching" is 
      undertaken. Postoperatively, the DOACs can be reinstituted within the first 24 
      hours. In cases of major surgery or if there is a higher risk of bleeding, 
      resumption of DOACS should only begin after 24-72 hours. In patients with an 
      elevated thromboembolic risk, transient postoperative LMWH administration can be 
      recommended during this period.Interaction of DOACs with other drugs usually 
      occurs during the absorption, transport and elimination of these drugs. 
      Therefore, substance- specific restrictions and recommendations should be 
      observed during these times. In everyday clinical practice, webbased, independent 
      information portals on drug-interactions are very helpful in providing safe and 
      rapid information about potential interactions when DOACs are used in combination 
      with other drugs, especially during perioperative management.Non-adherence to 
      medications is a worldwide problem that has dangerous and costly consequences. 
      Present data suggest that persistence is the primary factor that supports 
      adherence. Despite the adherence data presented in the DOACS approval studies 
      (e.g., persistence in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism has been 
      reported to be between 94-99%), the first registries and meta-analyses provide 
      sobering results regarding the incidence of persistence and the success rate of 
      interventions designed to improve adherence with DOACs in cases of long-term 
      usage.

PG  - 617-22

AB  - The introduction of factor Xa inhibitors advocated the initiation of clinical 
      trials that addressed the value of anticoagulation in patients with 
      hemodynamically stable primary pulmonary embolism (PE). In the Matisse trial in 
      patients with PE, fondaparinux administered at therapeutic doses followed by 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKA) has shown a comparable efficacy and safety profile to 
      that seen with intravenous adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin/VKA. A 
      long-acting derivative of fondaparinux, idraparinux, failed to achieve similar 
      results. On the other hand, the Cassiopea study revealed that once weekly 
      injections of idrabiotaparinux, a slightly modified form of idraparinux, have 
      similar efficacy and better safety profile compared to VKAs in the long-term 
      treatment of patients with PE. However, the inconvenient parenteral 
      administration of both fondaparinux and idrabiotaparinux limits their routine 
      clinical use. The availability of antithrombotic compounds that can be 
      administered orally in fixed dose, owing to their predictable pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics, and have a lower potential for drug and food interactions 
      has opened new horizons for the treatment of patients with PE. The Einstein PE, 
      Amplify and Hokusai studies, conducted with rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, 
      respectively, showed that for the treatment of PE they possess a more favorable 
      benefit-to-risk profile than the conventional antithrombotic drugs. In addition, 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban make it possible to treat uncomplicated PE patients from 
      the beginning, without the need for the parenteral administration of heparins or 
      fondaparinux, and edoxaban allows the treatment of fragile patients with lower 
      doses. All of them cover a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including PE 
      patients at intermediate risk.

AB  - The use of warfarin, the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant, is being 
      questioned by clinicians worldwide due to warfarin several limitations (a limited 
      therapeutic window and significant variability in dose-response among 
      individuals, in addition to a potential for drug-drug interactions). Therefore, 
      the need for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with a rapid 
      onset of antithrombotic effects and a predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamic (PD) profile led to the approval of five new drugs: the direct 
      factor Xa (F-Xa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban (newly 
      approved by FDA) and the direct thrombin (factor-IIa) inhibitor dabigatran 
      etexilate. The advantages of NOACs over warfarin are a fixed-dosage, the absence 
      of the need for drug monitoring for changes in anti-coagulation and fewer 
      clinically significant PK and PD drug-drug interactions. NOACs exposure will 
      likely be increased by the administration of strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-inhibitors and may increase the risk of bleeds. On the 
      contrary, P-gp inducers could significantly decrease the NOACs plasma 
      concentration with an associated reduction in their anticoagulant effects. This 
      manuscript gives an overview of NOACs PK profiles and their drug-drug 
      interactions potential. This is meant to be of help to physicians in choosing the 
      best therapeutic approach for their patients.

TI  - Importance of measuring pharmacologically active metabolites of edoxaban: 
      development and validation of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography 
      coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry method.
PG  - 395-403

AB  - Although DOACs do not require regular measurements of their blood concentrations, 
      clinical situations may require an assessment of their concentration. Among the 
      factor Xa inhibitors, edoxaban is the only compound for which some metabolites 
      (e.g. edoxaban-M4) are reported to be pharmacologically active. Therefore, their 
      contribution could interfere with assays used for the estimation of edoxaban 
      concentration. In addition, drug interactions may alter the metabolite/parent 
      compound ratio making the sole estimation of edoxaban concentration, a poor 
      assessment of the overall anticoagulation. To develop a validated UHPLC-MS/MS 
      method to quantify simultaneously edoxaban and its more relevant M4-metabolite in 
      human plasma. Electrospray ionization and chromatographic separation were 
      optimized for the simultaneous dosage of edoxaban and edoxaban-M4. The method was 
      validated according to regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. 
      The total run time was 6 min. The method was validated for calibration curves, 
      precision, accuracy, carry-over, selectivity, matrix effect and short-time 
      stability. This method permits quantification of edoxaban and edoxaban-M4 
      providing complementary information about the inhibitory effect of this active 
      metabolite in chronometric or chromogenic assays. Although patients treated with 
      edoxaban exhibits usually low concentrations of active metabolites, the 
      measurement of edoxaban-M4 is interesting; especially in case of drug 
      interactions. Indeed, concomitant prescriptions of edoxaban and carbamazepine or 
      rifampicin is frequent and may lead to disturbance of the estimations of edoxaban 
      concentration by chromogenic anti-Xa assays. Therefore, patients are at risk of 
      having inadequate control of anticoagulation supporting the need of measuring the 
      most representative edoxaban metabolite concomitantly to the parent compound.

TI  - Bleeding in patients receiving non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: clinical trial 
      evidence.
PG  - 361-380
LID - 10.1177/1753944718801554 [doi]
AB  - In optimizing anticoagulation therapy, it is essential to balance treatment 
      efficacy with the major adverse effect of anticoagulant treatment, bleeding risk. 
      This narrative review examines the efficacy and safety of the non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
      edoxaban compared with standard anticoagulation or placebo. NOAC therapies 
      provide equivalent to superior protection versus standard therapy, with similar 
      or superior safety, and potential benefits in convenience. We will review the 
      phase III evidence for each of the available NOACs in different antithrombotic 
      indications, including atrial fibrillation (in the absence of significant mitral 
      stenosis or mechanical heart valves); prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery; and acute and long-term treatment of 
      VTE. Further, we will illustrate scenarios in which the evidence is stronger for 
      a particular agent in the context of the overall positive safety and efficacy 
      profile of NOACs in general. Limitations of the factor Xa inhibitors include the 
      lack of a specific antidote in case of a bleeding emergency (an approved agent is 
      available for reversing the effect of the direct thrombin inhibitor). We discuss 
      the options for mitigating bleeding and describe the ongoing developments towards 
      specific reversal agents. In conclusion, the available data for efficacy and 
      safety, together with reliable pharmacokinetics obviating the need for regular 
      monitoring, indicate that NOACs may offer substantial benefits for patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or VTE.

TI  - Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parent-metabolite model of 
      edoxaban to predict drug-drug-disease interactions: M4 contribution.
PG  - 1093-1106
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12977 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
      pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) parent-metabolite model of edoxaban, an oral 
      anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic index, and to predict pharmacokinetic 
      (PK)/PD profiles and potential drug-drug-disease interactions (DDDIs) in patients 
      with renal impairment. A whole-body PBPK model with a linear additive PD model of 
      edoxaban and its active metabolite M4 was developed and validated in SimCYP for 
      healthy adults with or without interacting drugs. The model was extrapolated to 
      situations including renal impairment and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Observed 
      PK and PD data in adults were compared with predicted data. The effect of several 
      model parameters on the PK/PD response of edoxaban and M4 was investigated in 
      sensitivity analysis. The PBPK/PD model successfully predicted PK profiles of 
      edoxaban and M4 as well as anticoagulation PD responses with or without the 
      influence of interacting drugs. For patients with renal impairment, the PBPK 
      model successfully predicted the fold change in each impairment group. Inhibitory 
      DDI and renal impairment had a synergistic effect on the increased exposure of 
      edoxaban and M4, and their downstream anticoagulation PD effect. Sensitivity 
      analysis and DDDI simulation show that renal clearance, intestinal P-glycoprotein 
      activity, and hepatic OATP1B1 activity are the major factors affecting 
      edoxaban-M4 PK profiles and PD responses. Anticoagulation effect induced by M4 
      cannot be ignored when OATP1B1 is inhibited or downregulated. Our study provides 
      a reasonable approach to adjust the dose of edoxaban in several complicated 
      scenarios especially when M4 cannot be ignored due to decreased OATP1B1 activity.

TI  - Efficacy and Harms of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in the Elderly for Stroke 
      Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation and Secondary Prevention of Venous 
      Thromboembolism: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 194-204
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      the elderly, particularly bleeding risks, is unclear despite the presence of 
      greater comorbidities, polypharmacy, and altered pharmacokinetics in this age 
      group. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized trials of DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) for 
      efficacy and bleeding outcomes in comparison with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in 
      elderly participants (aged ≥75 years) treated for acute venous thromboembolism or 
      stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Nineteen studies were eligible for 
      inclusion, but only 11 reported data specifically for elderly participants. The 
      efficacy in managing thrombotic risks for each DOAC was similar or superior to 
      VKA in elderly patients. A nonsignificantly higher risk of major bleeding than 
      with VKA was observed with dabigatran 150 mg (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.97-1.44) but not with the 110-mg dose. Significantly higher 
      gastrointestinal bleeding risks with dabigatran 150 mg (1.78, 1.35-2.35) and 
      dabigatran 110 mg (1.40, 1.04-1.90) and lower intracranial bleeding risks than 
      VKA for dabigatran 150 mg (0.43, 0.26-0.72) and dabigatran 110 mg (0.36, 
      0.22-0.61) were also observed. A significantly lower major bleeding risk in 
      comparison with VKA was observed for apixaban (0.63, 0.51-0.77), edoxaban 60 mg 
      (0.81, 0.67-0.98), and 30 mg (0.46, 0.38-0.57), whereas rivaroxaban showed 
      similar risks. CONCLUSIONS: DOACs demonstrated at least equal efficacy to VKA in 
      managing thrombotic risks in the elderly, but bleeding patterns were distinct. In 
      particular, dabigatran was associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal 
      bleeding than VKA. Insufficient published data for apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban indicate that further work is needed to clarify the bleeding risks of 
      these DOACs in the elderly. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - [Implementation of edoxaban anti-Xa activity assay in a hospital laboratory and 
      evaluation of its analytical performance].
PG  - 451-460
LID - 10.1684/abc.2024.1910 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant available in Europe but not in France. 
      Given the high tourist traffic in France, understanding the pharmacology of 
      edoxaban and the availability of its laboratory testing seemed crucial in 
      emergency situations. The aim of this work was to describe the methodology for 
      measuring the anti-Xa activity of edoxaban, highlighting pre-analytical and 
      analytical aspects, along with essential clinico-biological data for therapeutic 
      guidance. The analysis was performed using the chromogenic method on the STAR-Max 
      analyzer, with the STA®-Liquid ANTI-Xa kit (Diagnostica Stago®). Anti-Xa Edoxaban 
      level measurement has a detection limit of 15 ng/mL, a quantification limit of 20 
      ng/mL and a linearity limit of 400 ng/mL. Repeatability, intermediate precision, 
      accuracy, and measurement uncertainty studies were conducted to assess method 
      performance, meeting quality requirements. The comparison between two STAR-Max® 
      analyzers showed excellent results with linear regression and a low bias with 
      good precision and no loss of dispersion regardless of edoxaban levels. In 
      conclusion, although the measurement of edoxaban level may be rarely necessary in 
      clinical practice, its implementation is straightforward. The availability of 
      edoxaban in neighboring countries, underscores the importance of having its 
      measurement available in hospital laboratories.

AB  - New oral factor Xa inhibitors are intended to progressively substitute the oral 
      vitamin K antagonists and parenteral indirect inhibitors of factor Xa in the 
      prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolic episodes. This 
      article focuses on the main clinical studies and on biological measurements of 
      new oral factor Xa inhibitors, and addresses several safety issues. These newer 
      agents do not require any routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation; 
      however, biological tests have been developed in order to assess the plasma 
      concentration of these drugs in several clinical settings. This article reviews 
      these 4 oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.

TI  - A quantitative LC/MSMS method for determination of edoxaban, a Xa inhibitor and 
      its pharmacokinetic application in patients after total knee arthroplasty.

AB  - Edoxaban was extracted from human plasma by simple protein precipitation with 
      acetonitrile, followed by quantitative determination using a liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The recoveries of edoxaban and the 
      internal standard (ticlopidine) from human plasma were >85%, and the within- and 
      between-day coefficients of variation were within 15%. The limit of 
      quantification in human plasma was 1 ng/mL. The concentration of edoxaban in 
      blood decreased at room temperature, but remained unchanged for 1 week at 4°C. On 
      the other hand, the concentration in plasma at both -20 and -80°C remained 
      unchanged for 5 months. These results indicated that blood samples should be 
      centrifuged immediately or stored at 4°C, and that plasma samples should be 
      stored below -20°C until analysis. This method was applied to human plasma 
      obtained from four patients after total knee arthroplasty. Analysis of edoxaban 
      pharmacokinetics demonstrated an absorption time lag of 4h, a maximum 
      concentration of 110 ± 26 ng/mL and an oral clearance of 37 ± 16 L/h. The 
      analytical methods established in this study will be suitable for determining the 
      concentrations of edoxaban in human plasma.

      variants & future perspectives.
PG  - 209-221
LID - 10.2217/pme-2017-0092 [doi]
AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are becoming a therapy of choice in everyday 
      clinical practice after almost 50 years during which warfarin and related 
      coumarin derivatives were used as the main anticoagulants. Advantages of NOACs 
      over standard anticoagulants include their predictable pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics, stable plasma concentrations and less drug-drug and food-drug 
      interactions. However, pharmacogenetics has its place in administration of NOACs, 
      as considerable interindividual variations have been detected. In this review, 
      previous findings in pharmacogenetics of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban are summarized, along with recommendations for studying genes encoding 
      metabolically important enzymes for four selected NOACs. Future directions 
      include identification of clinically relevant SNPs, and change in optimum dosage 
      for patients who are carriers of significant variants.

AB  - Anticoagulation in patients with impaired kidney function can be challenging 
      since drugs' pharmacokinetics and bioavailability are altered in this setting. 
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) treated with conventional 
      anticoagulant agents [vitamin K antagonist (VKA), low-molecular weight heparin 
      (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH)] are at high risk of bleeding events (both 
      non-major and major clinically relevant bleeding). While anticoagulation reduces 
      the risk of thromboembolic events, the co-existing bleeding risk and the fact 
      that the most commonly used anticoagulation agents are eliminated via the kidneys 
      pose additional challenges. More recently, two classes of direct oral 
      anticoagulant agents (DOACs) have been investigated for the prevention and 
      management of venous thromboembolic events: the direct factor Xa inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. 
      In this review, we discuss the complex challenges and the practical 
      considerations associated with the management of anticoagulation treatment in 
      patients with CKD, with a special focus on DOACs.

AB  - Until the last decade, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the only agents 
      available for oral anticoagulation. Although effective and accessible, their use 
      was complicated by a narrow therapeutic window, the need for regular monitoring 
      of the international normalized ratio, and an associated susceptibility to 
      interactions with both food and numerous medications. Furthermore, the onset of 
      action was delayed, often requiring bridging with intravenous agents. In more 
      recent years, we have enjoyed the development of nonvitamin-K-dependent, direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which either directly inhibit the activity of factor 
      IIa (eg, dabigatran) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). These 
      medications boast a more rapid onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetics, 
      wider therapeutic window, and equal or superior safety profiles. Although these 
      medications appear to have fewer drug-drug interactions than VKAs, their 
      interactions remain of clinical importance, particularly in one of the largest 
      populations requiring anticoagulation: patients with atrial fibrillation. These 
      patients are rarely on single medications, with the majority of them requiring 
      some form of rate or rhythm control due to their arrhythmia. Unfortunately, data 
      on interactions between DOACs and antiarrhythmic medications, despite their 
      common coadministration, remain limited. Here, we summarize the interactions 
      between antiarrhythmics and VKAs and review existing knowledge regarding their

TI  - Edoxaban Dosing Time Affects Blood Coagulation Inhibition in Rats.
PG  - e107-e112
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1725041 [doi]
AB  - Coagulation-fibrinolytic system activity shows daily rhythmicity, with 
      hypercoagulability in the morning and hypocoagulability in the evening. 
      Consequently, the efficacy of anticoagulants may be influenced by their dosing 
      time. Edoxaban, a selective inhibitor of the active form of coagulation factor X 
      (FXa), is taken orally once daily, but the optimal dosing time is unknown. This 
      study evaluated the dosing time-dependent effects of edoxaban on coagulation 
      activity and thrombus formation in rats. Edoxaban (10 mg/kg) or vehicle was 
      administered to Wistar rats at zeitgeber time (ZT)-2 (beginning of the light 
      phase) or ZT14 (beginning of the dark phase), followed by blood collection at 
      ZT4, ZT10, ZT16, or ZT22, to measure the activity of coagulation factors and 
      edoxaban concentrations, or followed by inferior vena cava ligations at ZT4 or 
      ZT16, to assess the efficacy of edoxaban against thrombus formation. Coagulation 
      FX activity was high during the light phase, and a single dose of edoxaban 
      administered at ZT2 inhibited FX activity and thrombus formation more potently 
      compared with the same dose administered at ZT14. The inhibitory effects during 
      the light phase could be attributed, at least in part, to the high blood 
      concentration of edoxaban achieved by dosing at ZT2. Morning dosing of edoxaban 
      leads to a high blood concentration of the drug during the morning hours and thus 
      may better counteract the hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolytic activity 
      characteristic of the morning hours. Optimizing the dosing time may contribute to 
      improving the efficacy of edoxaban.

PG  - 1665-77
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2015.1085022 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K antagonists were the only oral anticoagulants available 
      for several decades, but they require frequent coagulation monitoring and dose 
      adjustment. The direct oral anticoagulants rivaroxaban , dabigatran, apixaban, 
      and, most recently, edoxaban have been approved for the management of specific 
      thromboembolic indications. AREAS COVERED: This review will provide a brief 
      overview of the cell-based coagulation model, the main determinants of arterial 
      and venous thrombosis, and the pharmacological rationale and clinical evidence 
      for the different dosing regimens of rivaroxaban. Published articles indexed on 
      PubMed and Medline covering arterial and venous thrombi pathophysiology, 
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban, and Phase II and Phase III 
      clinical studies with rivaroxaban as well as real-world evidence were analyzed. 
      EXPERT OPINION: Education on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics, as 
      well as how to manage adverse events, is needed to increase physician knowledge 
      and confidence in using direct oral anticoagulants, as specifically discussed for 
      rivaroxaban in this article. The continued uptake of direct oral anticoagulants 
      in clinical practice depends on understanding of the clinical evidence and 
      reassurance provided by emerging real-world data.

TI  - Linking Endogenous Factor Xa Activity, a Biologically Relevant Pharmacodynamic 
      Marker, to Edoxaban Plasma Concentrations and Clinical Outcomes in the ENGAGE 
      AF-TIMI 48 Trial.
PG  - 1963-1973
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.033933 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported exogenous antifactor Xa (FXa) activity as a 
      pharmacokinetic surrogate marker for edoxaban plasma concentrations. Inhibition 
      of endogenous FXa activity is a more biologically relevant pharmacodynamic 
      measure of edoxaban activity. Here we describe the value of endogenous FXa 
      activity as a pharmacodynamic marker linking edoxaban concentrations and clinical 
      outcomes in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa 
      Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 
      Study 48). METHODS: In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, edoxaban was administered in higher 
      dose (60/30 mg QD) and lower dose (30/15 mg QD) regimens. Both regimens 
      incorporated a 50% dose reduction in patients with characteristics known to 
      increase edoxaban concentration. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was 
      performed in a subgroup of 3029 patients who had samples collected for endogenous 
      FXa activity (measured using an assay after endogenous FX was activated with 
      Russell viper venom). RESULTS: Endogenous FXa activity decreased with increasing 
      edoxaban concentrations of ≤440 ng/mL, indicating that inhibition of endogenous 
      FXa activity is saturated above this concentration threshold. Baseline endogenous 
      FXa activity averaged 92.1±20.9% (relative to normal control samples) and was 
      lower with older age, with lower body weight, and in male patients. 
      Model-predicted 24-hour average percentages of inhibition of endogenous FXa 
      activity were 35.8±5.18, 29.1±3.92, 21.9±3.80, and 16.4±2.70 for the higher dose 
      edoxaban regimen 60 mg, dose-reduced higher dose edoxaban regimen 30 mg, lower 
      dose edoxaban regimen 30 mg, and dose-reduced lower dose edoxaban regimen 15 mg 
      groups, respectively. A greater average percentage of inhibition of endogenous 
      FXa activity was associated with a lower incidence of ischemic stroke or systemic 
      embolism and a higher risk of major bleeding ( P<0.001). In a typical subject, 
      the predicted risks for the 10th and 90th percentiles of inhibition of endogenous 
      FXa activity were 1.04% and 0.57% for incidence of ischemic stroke or systemic 
      embolism and 1.35% and 2.33% for major bleeding, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      extent of inhibition of endogenous FXa activity is influenced by edoxaban dosing 
      and clinical characteristics, and it is associated with both antithrombotic 
      benefit and risk of bleeding. This approach of linking endogenous FXa activity to 
      clinical outcomes may be used to guide dose selection in future clinical trials, 
      monitor patients in certain clinical scenarios, or refine the doses of oral FXa 
      inhibitors in patients who require precise anticoagulation therapy. CLINICAL

      it is used in the treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). Concurrently, the time 
      course of the activities of the cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C19, and 2D6 was 
      assessed. METHODS: In an open-label, fixed sequence clinical trial, the effect 
      and duration of a 5-day oral ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) treatment on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three oral microdosed FXaI (rivaroxaban 25 µg, apixaban 
      25 µg, and edoxaban 50 µg) and microdosed probe drugs (midazolam 25 µg, yohimbine 
      50 µg, and omeprazole 100 µg) was evaluated in eight healthy volunteers. The 
      plasma concentrations of all drugs were quantified using validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods and pharmacokinetics 
      were analysed using non-compartmental analyses. RESULTS: Ritonavir increased the 
      exposure of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, but to a different extent the 
      observed area under the plasma concentration-time curve (geometric mean ratio 
      1.29, 1.46, and 1.87, respectively). A strong CYP3A4 inhibition (geometric mean 
      ratio > 10), a moderate CYP2C19 induction 2 days after ritonavir (0.64), and no 
      alteration of CYP2D6 were observed. A CYP3A4 recovery half-life of 2.3 days was 
      determined. CONCLUSION: This trial with three microdosed FXaI suggests that at 
      most the rivaroxaban dose should be reduced during short-term ritonavir, and only 
      in patients receiving high maintenance doses. Thorough time series analyses 
      demonstrated differential effects on three different drug-metabolising enzymes 
      over time with immediate profound inhibition of CYP3A4 and only slow recovery 
      after discontinuation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 
      2021-006643-39.

AB  - Use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including dabigatran 
      etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban or betrixaban provides a safe and 
      convenient alternative to the traditional anticoagulation with vitamin K 
      antagonists or heparin derivatives. Many patients receiving long-term seizure 
      prophylaxis with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may require anticoagulation with 
      NOACs. Providers caring for these patients need to be informed about potential 
      interactions between AEDs and NOACs and the relevant clinical consequences. A 
      systematic review of the existing literature was conducted to elucidate current 
      knowledge on the clinically relevant interactions between AEDs and NOACs and 
      highlight areas in which further research is needed. The systematic review 
      protocol was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
      and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library 
      and SciFinder were searched. Of the 630 non-duplicate items identified by the 
      search, 13 met eligibility criteria. These 13 items included 8 case reports, 2 
      letters to the editor and 3 nonrandomized studies. The majority of 
      pharmacokinetic interactions between NOACs and first generation AEDs occurred via 
      the induction of the hepatic enzyme system and competition for the P-glycoprotein 
      transporter and lead to decreased NOAC plasma levels and consequent thrombotic 
      events. Only one article, a case report, was identified that focused on 
      interactions between the second generation AED and a NOAC. At the present time, 
      the limited evidence suggests that enzyme-inducing or inhibiting AEDs reduce the 
      effectiveness of anticoagulation produced by several NOACs. This information may 
      help providers anticipate possible interactions and guide therapy appropriately.

PG  - 1031-45
LID - 10.1177/1060028015591846 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review current literature for target-specific oral anticoagulants 
      (TSOACs) and provide critical analysis for dosing recommendations in special 
      population groups. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted in Medline 
      (1996 to April week 2 2015) and Embase (1980 to 2015 week 16) using key terms 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, kidney diseases, liver diseases, 
      elderly, obesity, and special populations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: 
      Randomized controlled trials in English assessing efficacy and safety of TSOACs 
      in healthy adults and special populations were selected for analysis. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Phase 3 trials for TSOACs predominately excluded patients with severe 
      renal impairment or active liver disease. There were no exclusion criteria based 
      on age, body weight or body mass index. Additional conclusions were made in 
      special populations, including those with renal or liver impairment and obese and 
      elderly patients, based on secondary analyses, pharmacokinetic, and 
      pharmacodynamic studies. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes 
      associated special populations may alter clinical decision with regard to drug 
      selection and dosing. It is valuable to understand the rationale for labeled 
      dosing recommendations in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous 
      thromboembolism treatment and prevention, particularly in patients that fall into 
      special population groups. Furthermore, the use of TSOACs is likely to increase 
      as clinicians gain experience with these agents and additional TSOACs and 
      indications are approved.

AB  - Edoxaban is mainly enzymatically converted to a 4-carboxylic acid form (4CA-EDX) 
      and an N-desmethyl form (ND-EDX) in humans. This study aimed to establish a 
      simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using core-shell 
      octadecyl silica (ODS) microparticles for the simultaneous quantitation of 
      edoxaban and its two major metabolites in human plasma. Analytes extracted from 
      plasma specimens by a one-step deproteinization were separated using a 2.6-µm 
      core-shell ODS microparticulate column and linear acetonitrile-ammonium acetate 
      gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min with a run time of 7 min. The mass 
      spectrometer was operated in the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode. 
      Plasma samples collected from 20 patients with atrial fibrillation were analyzed 
      by the present method. The chromatograms of drug-free human plasma had no 
      interfering peaks. The calibration curves of edoxaban, 4CA-EDX, and ND-EDX were 
      linear over the concentration ranges of 1.25-160, 0.47-60, and 0.12-15 ng/mL, 
      respectively. Their pretreatment recoveries and matrix factors were 88.7-109.0% 
      and 87.0-101.6%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and imprecision 
      values were 85.9-112.8% and within 13.3%, respectively. The plasma concentrations 
      of edoxaban, 4CA-EDX, and ND-EDX in the patients had ranges of 17.8-102, 
      1.67-25.7, and 0.685-5.34 ng/mL, respectively. All the analytes were measurable 
      within their calibration curves. In conclusion, this validated method for the 
      simultaneous determination of edoxaban and its major metabolites was successfully 
      applied to plasma specimens obtained from patients with atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Renal impairment increases risk of stroke and systemic embolic events and 
      bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have varied dependence on renal elimination, magnifying the importance of 
      appropriate patient selection, dosing, and periodic kidney function monitoring. 
      In randomized controlled trials of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, DOACs were at 
      least as effective and associated with less bleeding compared with warfarin. Each 
      direct oral anticoagulant was associated with reduced risk of stroke and systemic 
      embolic events and major bleeding compared with warfarin in nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Renal function 
      decrease appears less impacted by DOACs, which are associated with a better 
      risk-benefit profile than warfarin in patients with decreasing renal function 
      over time. Limited data address the risk-benefit profile of DOACs in patients 
      with severe impairment or on dialysis.

TI  - The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients-A systematic 
      review.
PG  - 463-480
LID - 10.1111/sdi.13098 [doi]
AB  - Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for prevention of 
      thromboembolic events, but their use in dialysis patients is debatable. This 
      study investigated the available evidence for the use of NOACs in dialysis 
      patients. Online databases were systematically searched for eligible studies 
      including pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, cohort studies, and randomized control 
      trials (RCTs) comparing NOAC with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or no anticoagulant 
      treatment. Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of bias tool were used for 
      quality assessment. Twenty studies were identified (nine PK studies, two RCTs, 
      and nine cohort studies). Most of the studies investigated apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban. In dialysis patients, less accumulation was reported with apixaban 
      and rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran and edoxaban. PK studies indicate that 
      high dose apixaban or rivaroxaban should be avoided. The two RCTs 
      (rivaroxaban/apixaban vs. VKA) were small and underpowered regarding stroke and 
      bleeding outcomes. Most cohort studies found apixaban superior to VKA, whereas 
      comparison of rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Cohort studies 
      comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg) with low dose (2.5 mg) twice daily suggest a 
      lower risk of stroke with high dose but also a higher risk of bleeding with high 
      dose. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did 
      not lower the risk of stroke compared with non-treated regardless of apixaban 
      dosage. Widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by adequately 
      sized RCTs. Available evidence suggests a potential for use of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban in reduced dose.

TI  - Current Antithrombotic Therapy Strategies in Children with a Focus on Off-Label 
      Direct Oral Anticoagulants-A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/children9071093 [doi]
LID - 1093
AB  - (1) Background: The incidence of thromboembolic events is relatively low in the 
      general population, but it increases in hospitalized children and those who 
      underwent thrombogenic procedures. Although the evidence regarding direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) in children with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is growing, 
      DOACs were excluded from existing guidelines due to the lack of reliable data at 
      that moment. Therefore, current evidence on VTE management in children needs to 
      be critically reviewed. (2) Methods: We have conducted a literature search in the 
      Scopus, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases using prespecified keywords to retrieve 
      studies published between 2010 and 2022. (3) Results: Clinical trials highlighted 
      that rivaroxaban and dabigatran had predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles in children, similar to those observed in adults. 
      Dabigatran and rivaroxaban had a similar safety profile to standard therapy but 
      improved thrombotic burden and resolution during follow-up. Most studies 
      involving apixaban and edoxaban are ongoing, and results are awaited. (4) 
      Conclusions: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban could be valid therapeutic options for 
      VTE management in children. In the case of apixaban and edoxaban, results from 
      ongoing clinical studies are required before using them in pediatric VTE.

TI  - In vitro assessment of inhibitory effects of kinase inhibitors on CYP2C9, 3A and 
      1A2: Prediction of drug-drug interaction risk with warfarin and direct oral 
      anticoagulants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated 
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of kinase inhibitors with warfarin and 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). METHODS: An in vitro CYP probe substrate 
      cocktail assay was used to study the inhibitory effects of fifteen kinase 
      inhibitors on CYP2C9, 3A, and 1A2. Then, DDI predictions were performed using 
      both mechanistic static and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. 
      RESULTS: Linsitinib, masitinib, regorafenib, tozasertib, trametinib, and 
      vatalanib were identified as competitive CYP2C9 inhibitors (K(i) = 1.4, 1.0, 1.1, 
      3.8, 0.5, and 0.1 μM, respectively). Masitinib and vatalanib were competitive 
      CYP3A inhibitors (K(i) = 1.3 and 0.2 μM), and vatalanib noncompetitively 
      inhibited CYP1A2 (K(i) = 2.0 μM). Moreover, linsitinib and tozasertib were CYP3A 
      time-dependent inhibitors (K(I) = 26.5 and 400.3 μM, k(inact) = 0.060 and 0.026 
      min(-1), respectively). Only linsitinib showed time-dependent inhibition of 
      CYP1A2 (K(I) = 13.9 μM, k(inact) = 0.018 min(-1)). Mechanistic static models 
      identified possible DDI risks for linsitinib and vatalanib with 
      (S)-/(R)-warfarin, and for masitinib with (S)-warfarin. PBPK simulations further 
      confirmed that vatalanib may increase (S)- and (R)-warfarin exposure by 4.37- and 
      1.80-fold, respectively, and that linsitinib may increase (R)-warfarin exposure 
      by 3.10-fold. Mechanistic static models predicted a smaller risk of DDIs between 
      kinase inhibitors and apixaban or rivaroxaban. The greatest AUC increases 
      (1.50-1.74) were predicted for erlotinib in combination with apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Linsitinib, masitinib, and vatalanib were predicted to have a 
      smaller effect on apixaban and rivaroxaban AUCs (AUCR 1.22-1.53). No kinase 
      inhibitor was predicted to increase edoxaban exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that several kinase inhibitors, including vatalanib and linsitinib, can 
      cause CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions with warfarin and, to a lesser extent, 
      with apixaban and rivaroxaban. The work provides mechanistic insights into the 
      risk of DDIs between kinase inhibitors and anticoagulants, which can be used to 
      avoid preventable DDIs in the clinic.

TI  - Review of the Target-Specific Oral Anticoagulants in Development for the 
      Treatment and Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism.
PG  - 392-405
LID - 10.1177/0897190014568388 [doi]
AB  - Anticoagulation therapy is often indicated for the treatment and prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite advances in anticoagulant management with 
      parenteral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists, limitations to their use 
      still exists, leading to investigation of alternative anticoagulants such as 
      factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors. To date, 3 target-specific 
      oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) are Food and Drug Administration approved; several 
      other agents are currently in development to optimize VTE management and minimize 
      bleeding risks. The objective of this systematic review article is to provide 
      clinicians an overview of the clinical evidence on the investigational TSOACs for 
      the treatment and prevention of VTE. Of the agents in development, edoxaban holds 
      the most promise due to robust data supporting its clinical benefit with a 
      similar bleeding risk to currently approved agents. Clinicians should understand 
      the TSOACs under investigation, since differences in pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics may influence clinical decision making and agent selection for 
      management of VTE. Currently, no direct comparisons between TSOACs have been 
      conducted. Agents under investigation have yet to overcome the major limitations 
      of the currently existing TSOACs. Further studies are necessary to clarify which 
      TSOAC agent is best for management of VTE in clinical practice.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with direct anticoagulants in the 
      management of cancer-associated thrombosis.
PG  - 2369-2376
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15785 [doi]
AB  - Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are common in cancer management and complicate the 
      choice of anticoagulation in cancer-associated thrombosis. Cancer confers an 
      increased risk of thrombotic events. Also, more bleeding events are observed in 
      those who receive anticoagulation compared to those without cancer. In the 
      treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have been found to be at least as effective as low-molecular weight heparins, 
      which became the standard of care after several trials demonstrated superiority 
      over vitamin K antagonists. Non-inferiority compared to low-molecular weight 
      heparins has been shown for rivaroxaban, edoxaban and apixaban with a signal of 
      fewer recurrent thrombotic events, albeit with an increase in bleeding events. 
      Yet, potentially major pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been 
      identified as a reason to withhold DOACs and to rather choose an alternative. 
      Practical guidance on what constitutes a major pharmacokinetic interaction and/or 
      how to deal with these interactions in clinical practice is limited. Hence, here 
      we have provided a framework to allow clinicians to better deal with 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between DOACs and cancer therapies in the 
      management of cancer-associated thrombosis. In this review we have discussed the 
      current literature, how the pharmacokinetic profile links to the label 
      information on DDI, and have provided a practical proposal, applied to a clinical 
      case.

TI  - Review: An overview and analysis of novel oral anticoagulants and their dental 
      implications.
PG  - 78-86
LID - 10.1111/ger.12327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are approved novel 
      oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as alternatives to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA). 
      Physicians are prescribing an ever-increasing amount these drugs to their 
      patients due to various advantages over existing medications. AIMS: The objective 
      of this review is to provide the dental professional with current literature 
      surrounding the emergence of NOACs, as well as various case studies on the 
      subject, in an effort to guide clinical decision making regarding these 
      medications. The pharmacological profiles of these NOACs and idarucizumab, a 
      reversal agent for dabigatran, will be detailed in this review. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A review of the literature on NOACs was undertaken and the Pubmed, 
      Medline, and Embase databases were used to identify articles published in the 
      English language. Additionally, major dental medicine journals were hand 
      searched, followed by a review of the ClinicalTrials.gov database. RESULTS: Due 
      to minimal research regarding dental treatment of patients on NOACs and minimal 
      clinical experience of practitioners treating these patients, there is currently 
      insufficient data to establish an evidence-based NOAC management protocol in a 
      dental setting. DISCUSSION: In this review, the most significant advantages of 
      NOACs over VKAs was found to be limited interactions with other drugs as well as 
      rapid onset and offset of action. CONCLUSION: Despite these benefits, as well as 
      various others, NOACs still lack specific management parameters as well as 
      antidotes or reversal agents. Therefore, dental professionals must use caution 
      when treating patients currently taking these specific anticoagulants.

TI  - Nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use in patients with renal impairment.
PG  - 243-256
LID - 10.1177/1753944717714921 [doi]
AB  - The nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), also referred to as 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, have emerged as effective alternatives to vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) across several indications, including the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism (SSE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Their use in patients with renal 
      impairment is of particular importance, given the prevalence of renal dysfunction 
      in the indicated populations and the impact of renal function on the metabolism 
      of the NOACs. This publication reviews the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      properties of the NOACs and clinical trial results for patients with renal 
      impairment within the AF and VTE indications. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      data show the NOACs are dependent on renal clearance to varying extents. Relative 
      to VKAs, the efficacy and safety of the NOACs is preserved in patients with 
      moderate renal impairment. The dosing recommendations for patients with renal 
      impairment differ depending on the NOAC, whereby some of the NOACs require dose 
      reductions based solely on renal function, while others require consideration of 
      additional criteria. However, despite these specific dosing recommendations, 
      emerging real-world evidence suggests patients are not being dosed appropriately, 
      indicating a possible knowledge gap. Adherence to recommended dosing algorithms 
      has implications on the optimal efficacy and safety of the NOACs. To this end, 
      renal function should be assessed in patients on a NOAC, as worsening of renal 
      function may warrant change in the dose of a NOAC or change in oral 
      anticoagulant.

TI  - Perioperative Management of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs): A Systemic 
      Review.
PG  - 25-36
LID - 10.4137/HSI.S40701 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are in wide use among patients requiring both 
      short- and long-term anticoagulation, mainly due to their ease of use and the 
      lack of monitoring requirements. With growing use of DOACs, it is imperative that 
      physicians be able to manage patients on these medications, especially in the 
      perioperative period. We aim to provide guidance on the management of DOACs in 
      the perioperative period. In this review, we performed an extensive literature 
      search summarizing the management of patients on direct-acting anticoagulants in 
      the perioperative period. A total of four direct-acting oral anticoagulants were 
      considered appropriate for inclusion in this review. The drugs were dabigatran 
      etexilate mesylate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), and 
      edoxaban (Savaysa). Management of patients on DOACs in the perioperative period 
      involves an assessment of thromboembolic event risk while off anticoagulation 
      compared to the relative risk of bleeding if such drug is continued. DOACs may 
      not need to be discontinued in minor surgeries or procedures, and in major 
      surgeries, they may be discontinued hours prior depending on drug 
      pharmacokinetics and renal function of the patients.

TI  - Dilemmas Related to Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulant Administration in Patients 
      With Extreme Obesity.
PG  - 727-737
LID - 10.1177/10600280221130456 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to discuss the controversies 
      surrounding the use and dosing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      obese patients recognizing the limitations of the existing evidence base that 
      preclude strong recommendations. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE was 
      performed (2020 to end August 2022) subsequent to recent guidelines using the 
      following search terms: direct acting anticoagulants, obesity, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, and clinical practice 
      guidelines. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA ABSTRACTION: English-language studies and 
      those conducted in adults were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: The available randomized 
      studies evaluating DOACs had relatively small numbers of patients with more 
      extreme forms of obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 40 kg/m(2)) and none of the 
      larger studies had a specific focus on dosing DOACs in obese patients. Recent 
      guidelines by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) have 
      specific recommendations for dosing DOACs in obesity. There are 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and observational studies published before and 
      after the ISTH guidelines with a focus on DOAC dosing in obese patients that 
      generally support the recommendations in the guidelines, but most involved small 
      numbers of patients usually with BMIs <45 kg/m(2). RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review discusses DOAC dosing in obesity with important 
      considerations for clinicians related to DOAC choice and dosing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dosing alterations of DOACs do not appear to be necessary when used for either 
      prophylaxis or treatment in patients with BMIs up to approximately 45 to 50 
      kg/m(2), but research is needed for BMIs >50 kg/m(2).

AB  - The first direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) to be approved for clinical use was 
      dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, in 2010. Since that time, four 
      additional DOACs, all direct anti-Xa inhibitors, have been approved, including 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Our knowledge about the effect of 
      DOACs on laboratory testing, as well as the use of the laboratory for measuring 
      DOACs has been an evolving process. These drugs are not routinely monitored in 
      the same fashion as coumadin, but there is an increasing demand on the laboratory 
      to have the capacity to adequately assess DOAC anticoagulant effect 
      (pharmacodynamics) or levels (pharmacokinetics) in either emergent or the routine 
      situations. This manuscript provides an update on laboratory guidance and 
      progress of methods for measuring DOACs.

AB  - The treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is being completely modified 
      with the development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban directly inhibit factor Xa, whereas dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. 
      All these drugs are proposed orally, and share pharmacological similarities: 
      fixed doses without any therapeutic drug monitoring, key role of the transporter 
      proteins P-glycoprotein for all of them and metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 for the 
      anti-Xa, short half-life with variable rate of renal elimination. More than 25 
      000 patients with acute VTE were included in phase-III studies. Rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban challenged all the conventional therapy (parenteral heparins followed by 
      anti-vitamin K antagonists) whereas edoxaban and dabigatran challenged only 
      anti-vitamin K antagonists. All the DOACs met the non-inferiority efficacy 
      endpoint (recurrent VTE during treatment), whereas the large non-inferiority 
      margin was debated for dabigatran. However, they were associated with better 
      safety and a decreased risk of major bleeding. According to indirect comparisons, 
      there were no statistically significant differences between DOACs in terms of 
      efficacy but some differences are not excluded in term of safety. Although DOACs 
      allow for simplification of treatment in the majority of patients with acute VTE, 
      their risk/benefit ratio is questioned in elderly patients, patients with 
      mild-to-severe renal impairment, and in some clinical subgroups such as cancer or 
      chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Validated reversal strategies 
      (potentially based on laboratory monitoring) are expected for patients with major 
      bleeding, overdose or with a need for surgery.

PG  - 1465-1471
LID - 10.1007/s00228-021-03154-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are limited data regarding the safety of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) during breastfeeding. The aim of the present study is to 
      investigate the extent of excretion of DOACs into human milk according to the 
      available clinical and experimental studies. METHODS: On 16th January 2021, we 
      systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for all 
      studies which investigated DOACs in breastfeeding without any time frame and 
      language limitation. Search keywords were [breastfeeding, breast feeding, 
      breastfed, lactation, milk secretion OR milk] AND [apixaban OR Eliquist OR 
      rivaroxaban OR Xarelto OR edoxaban OR Savaysa OR dabigatran OR Pradaxa OR 
      dabigatran etexilate OR dabigatran etexilate mesylate OR direct oral 
      anticoagulant OR DOAC OR new oral anticoagulant OR NOAC]. Finally, we identified 
      six articles which reported DOAC use during breastfeeding or lactation. RESULTS 
      AND CONCLUSION: According to the available limited data, dabigatran has the least 
      excretion in human breast milk. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran both have acceptable 
      milk excretion cutoffs, whereas apixaban milk excretion is greater than the 
      maximum allowed range. Further well-designed studies with larger sample sizes are 
      required to generate consistent comparable data and clarify benefits and risks of 
      each DOAC during breastfeeding.

TI  - The Use of Edoxaban in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Venous 
      Thromboembolism: A Pharmacist's Perspective.
PG  - 26-34
LID - 10.1310/hpj5101-26 [doi]
AB  - Until 2010, the vitamin K antagonist warfarin was the only available oral 
      anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolic events (SEE) in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) in the United States. Despite its proven efficacy, the use 
      of warfarin is limited by numerous disadvantages, including a delayed onset of 
      action and variable efficacy resulting from interactions with genetic and 
      environmental factors. Consequently, optimal anticoagulation with warfarin 
      requires dose adjustments based on frequent monitoring. In contrast to warfarin, 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban have predictable pharmacokinetic profiles, few drug-drug 
      interactions, no known interactions with food, and can be administered at fixed 
      doses without the requirement for routine monitoring. All DOACs have received US 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the prevention of stroke or SEE 
      in patients with NVAF and the treatment of VTE based on phase 3 trials 
      demonstrating that they are at least as efficacious as warfarin. In addition, the 
      incidence of clinically relevant bleeding associated with DOACs is comparable to 
      or lower than with warfarin. In this article, the preclinical and clinical data 
      that led to the FDA approval of once-daily edoxaban in January 2015 are 
      presented. Furthermore, practical considerations for edoxaban use including 
      dosing recommendations, transitions of care, reversal of anticoagulation, 
      precautions, contraindications, and cost-effectiveness are discussed. Edoxaban is 
      an important addition to oral anticoagulation options available for the 
      therapeutic management of patients with NVAF or VTE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, a new generation of direct-acting oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) with a greater specificity towards activated coagulation factors was 
      introduced based on encouraging results for efficacy and safety in clinical 
      studies. An initial limitation of these new drugs was the absence of an adequate 
      strategy to reverse the effect if a bleeding event occurs or an urgent invasive 
      procedure has to be carried out. MAIN TEXT: Specific reversing agents for DOACs 
      have become available, however, and are now evaluated in clinical studies. For 
      the anti-factor Xa agents (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) a number of 
      studies have shown that the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate 
      resulted in a correction of the prolonged prothrombin time and restored depressed 
      thrombin generation after rivaroxaban treatment in a controlled trial in healthy 
      human subjects. In view of the relatively wide availability of prothrombin 
      complex concentrates, this would be an interesting option if the results can be 
      confirmed in patients on oral factor Xa inhibitors who present with bleeding 
      complications. More specific reversal can be achieved with andexanet, a new agent 
      currently in development that competitively binds to the anti-factor Xa agents. 
      For the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, the administration of prothrombin 
      complex concentrates showed variable results in various volunteer trials and 
      efficacy at relatively high doses in animal studies. Recently, a Fab fragment of 
      a monoclonal antibody (idarucizumab) was shown to be an effective reversal agent 
      for dabigatran in human studies. CONCLUSION: For the new generation of DOACs, 
      several reversal strategies and specific antidotes are under evaluation, although 
      most interventions need further evaluation in clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review clinical data on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in 
      the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as practical 
      considerations when using these products. DATA SOURCES: Searches of PubMed and 
      Google Scholar for VTE, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and relevant 
      drug international nonproprietary names were conducted. Additional online 
      searches were conducted for prescribing information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Relevant articles on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban 
      for the management of VTE compared with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; 
      published between 1966 and December 2015) were reviewed and summarized, together 
      with information on dosing, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and drug-drug 
      interactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: The DOACs have the potential to circumvent many of 
      the disadvantages of VKAs. At a minimum, they greatly increase the available 
      therapeutic options, thus providing a greater opportunity for clinicians to 
      select a management option that best fits the needs of individual patients. 
      Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk 
      and require careful consideration of a number of clinical issues to optimize 
      safety and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of DOACs for the management of 
      thromboembolic disorders represents a paradigm shift from oral VKAs. The DOACs 
      provide similar efficacy and improved safety in selected patients as compared 
      with VKAs. Clinicians treating VTE need to be familiar with the intricacies 
      involved in using these agents, including the appropriate dose selection for the 
      relevant indication, avoidance of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and 
      consideration of dose adjustments in specific clinical situations, such as organ 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Reversing factor Xa inhibitors - clinical utility of andexanet alfa.
PG  - 141-149
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S121550 [doi]
AB  - Approximately half of patients started on an oral anticoagulant in the USA now 
      receive one of the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Although there is an 
      approved reversal agent for the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, a specific 
      reversal agent for the anti-factor Xa (FXa) DOACs has yet to be licensed. Unlike 
      the strategy to reverse the only oral direct thrombin inhibitor with 
      idarucizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment, a different 
      approach is necessary to design a single agent that can reverse multiple anti-FXa 
      medications. Andexanet alfa is a FXa decoy designed to reverse all anticoagulants 
      that act through this part of the coagulation cascade including anti-FXa DOACs, 
      such as apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, and indirect FXa inhibitors such as 
      low-molecular-weight heparins. This narrative reviews the development of 
      andexanet alfa and explores its basic science, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, 
      animal models, and human studies.

AB  - Altering doses and regimens of a drug has consequences for the drug's 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Based on a half-life of 5-13 h, it 
      is expected that the Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban would be best suited to a 
      twice-daily rather than a once-daily dose regimen. However, although rivaroxaban 
      is used as a twice-daily regimen for the initial treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) and secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes, 
      the approved dosing is once-daily for prevention of VTE after orthopaedic 
      surgery, long-term secondary prevention of VTE and stroke prevention in patients 
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban dosing was based on the 
      evaluation of the efficacy and safety of several rivaroxaban doses and regimens 
      in phase II trials. A clear overall advantage of twice-daily dosing compared with 
      once-daily dosing was not documented for indications for which once-daily dosing 
      was subsequently selected. Once-daily dosing was therefore selected for these 
      indications because it is expected to be associated with better compliance than 
      twice-daily dosing, and potentially, with improved outcomes. These studies and 
      data obtained with another Factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, in addition to previous 
      experience with low molecular weight heparins, indicate that the clinical impact 
      of once-daily versus twice-daily doses on outcome in terms of efficacy and safety 
      cannot be reliably predicted from pharmacology data, e.g. elimination half-life, 
      obtained during pre-clinical and early phase I clinical studies but rather should 
      be ascertained empirically in phase II and III clinical trials.

      Does Not Fully Reflect Their Biologic Spectrum.

AB  - The currently available oral anti-Xa agents are claimed to produce their 
      anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects solely by the inhibition of factor Xa. 
      This study profiled various anti-Xa drugs in routinely used laboratory assays to 
      demonstrate that their effects are not solely related to the anti-Xa activities. 
      Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban were obtained commercially. 
      Native and citrated whole blood was used for the activated clotting time (ACT) 
      and thromboelastography (TEG). Citrated plasma was used for monitoring the 
      prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), Heptest, and 
      prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) tests. An amidolytic method was used 
      for the determination of anti-Xa effects. Thrombin-induced fibrinokinetics was 
      monitored optically. Thrombin generation studies were carried out using the 
      calibrated automated thrombogram. All of the anti-Xa agents produced 
      concentration- and assay-dependent effects. In the ACT at 2.5 μg/mL and TEG at 
      1.0 μg/mL, edoxaban exhibited the strongest anticoagulation effect. In the PiCT, 
      PT, and aPTT assay at 1 μg/mL, edoxaban showed stronger effects than other 
      agents. The half maximal inhibitory concentration of these agents for the 
      inhibition of factor Xa ranged from 340 to >1000 ng/mL. In the thrombin 
      generation inhibition assay, apixaban showed the strongest activity. In the 
      fibrinokinetics, different anti-Xa agents produced varying degrees of inhibition. 
      These results demonstrate that the measured anti-Xa activity alone does not fully 
      reflect the overall biologic spectrum of these agents.

AB  - Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is widely used to prevent and treat 
      thromboembolic events. Traditionally, warfarin has been the drug of choice and, 
      indeed, this drug is effective and provides a more than 60% reduction in stroke 
      risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, OAT entails an increased 
      bleeding risk, and management of this is challenging. Among other things, new 
      oral anticoagulant drugs offer fixed dosing, more predictable pharmacokinetics 
      and fewer interactions with drugs and food. Moreover, these drugs seem to provide 
      an improved benefit-risk ratio with respect to thromboembolic events and bleeding 
      complications in a broad patient population. The new drugs differ from 
      traditional OAT with respect to their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, 
      especially with respect to elimination through the kidneys. These drugs may 
      potentially cause bleeding complications in patients with reduced drug excretion 
      due to impaired renal function. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the 
      highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for 
      apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. Pharmacokinetic studies and data 
      from clinical studies have provided information on how to guide dosing in 
      patients with renal impairment. However, the risk of drug accumulation and 
      bleeding may be amplified by several drug-drug interactions. This article 
      provides a review of the literature on the pharmacology of new anticoagulant 
      drugs with particular focus on the impact of impaired renal function.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent cause of stroke. Secondary prophylaxis by 
      oral anticoagulants (OAC) is recommended after stroke in AF-patients. OAC can be 
      achieved by vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) like dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. 
      Seizures are frequent after stroke, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are indicated. 
      The review, based on a literature research, aims to give an overview about 
      pharmacokinetic knowledge and clinical data about drug-drug interactions (DDIs) 
      between NOACs and AED. Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin and 
      valproic acid might decrease the effect of NOACs by inducing P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) activity. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and 
      topiramate might decrease the effect of NOACs by inducing CYP3A4 activity. 
      Controversial data - inhibition as well as induction of CYP3A4 - were found about 
      valproic acid. The relevance of these DDIs is largely unknown since there are 
      only sporadic case reports available. To increase the knowledge about DDIs 
      between NOACs and AEDs we suggest subgroup analyses addressing effects and safety 
      of VKAs versus NOACs in patients with AF on AEDs, in case they have been included 
      in previously completed or still ongoing trials or registries. This could be 
      easily feasible and would be desirable in view of the large data already 
      accumulated.

TI  - Combined administration of antibiotics and direct oral anticoagulants: a renewed 
      indication for laboratory monitoring?
PG  - 756-65
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1381233 [doi]
AB  - The recent development and marketing of novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      represents a paradigm shift in the management of patients requiring long-term 
      anticoagulation. The advantages of these compounds over traditional therapy with 
      vitamin K antagonists include a reportedly lower risk of severe hemorrhages and 
      the limited need for laboratory measurements. However, there are several 
      scenarios in which testing should be applied. The potential for drug-to-drug 
      interaction is one plausible but currently underrecognized indication for 
      laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. In particular, 
      substantial concern has been raised during Phase I studies regarding the 
      potential interaction of these drugs with some antibiotics, especially those that 
      interplay with permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4). A 
      specific electronic search on clinical trials published so far confirms that 
      clarithromycin and rifampicin significantly impair the bioavailability of 
      dabigatran, whereas clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, and ketoconazole 
      alter the metabolism of rivaroxaban in vivo. Because of their more recent 
      development, no published data were found for apixaban and edoxaban, or for 
      potential interactions of DOACs with other and widely used antibiotics. It is 
      noteworthy, however, that an online resource based on Food and Drug 
      Administration and social media information, reports several hemorrhagic and 
      thrombotic events in patients simultaneously taking dabigatran and some commonly 
      used antibiotics such as amoxicillin, cephalosporin, and metronidazole. According 
      to these reports, the administration of antibiotics in patients undergoing 
      therapy with DOACs would seem to require accurate evaluation as to whether dose 
      adjustments (personalized or antibiotic class driven) of the anticoagulant drug 
      may be advisable. This might be facilitated by direct laboratory assessments of 
      their anticoagulant effect ex vivo.

TI  - Recommendations for the safe use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with 
      cirrhosis based on a systematic review of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and 
      safety data.
PG  - 797-812
LID - 10.1007/s00228-024-03648-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The popularity of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is increasing among 
      patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis has a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of 
      drugs, potentially increasing adverse events. Safe use of drugs in cirrhosis 
      requires a diligent risk-benefit analysis. The aim of this study is to develop 
      practice recommendations for safe use of DOACs in cirrhosis based on a systematic 
      review of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety data. METHODS: We conducted 
      a systematic literature search to identify studies on pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics and safety of DOACs in cirrhosis. Data were collected and 
      presented in summary tables by severity of cirrhosis using the 
      Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification. A multidisciplinary expert panel 
      evaluated the results and classified the DOACs according to safety. RESULTS: 
      Fifty four studies were included. All DOACs were classified as 'no additional 
      risks known' for CTP A. For CTP B, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban were 
      classified as 'no additional risks known'. Apixaban and edoxaban showed fewer 
      adverse events in patients with cirrhosis, while dabigatran may be less impacted 
      by severity of cirrhosis based on its pharmacokinetic profile. Rivaroxaban was 
      classified as 'unsafe' in CTP B and C based on significant pharmacokinetic 
      alterations. Due to lack of data, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban were 
      classified as 'unknown' for CTP C. CONCLUSION: DOACs can be used in patients with 
      CTP A cirrhosis, and apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban can also be used in CTP B. 
      It is recommended to avoid rivaroxaban in CTP B and C. There is insufficient 
      evidence to support safe use of other DOACs in CTP C cirrhosis.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): From the laboratory point of view.
PG  - 459-482
LID - 10.2478/acph-2022-0034 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent a new generation of drugs that have 
      been increasingly used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic states. 
      According to the mechanism of anticoagulant action, DOACs are divided into two 
      groups: direct inhibitors of thrombin (dabigatran) and direct inhibitors of 
      activated factor X (FXa) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban). Compared 
      to the vitamin K antagonists, DOACs are superior in terms of onset of action, 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties and fixed daily dose without the 
      need for routine coagulation monitoring. Despite these advantages, there are 
      clinical conditions in which laboratory measurement of DOACs should be performed. 
      Although DOACs have an impact on screening haemostasis assays (prothrombin time, 
      PT; activated partial thromboplastin time, aPTT; and thrombin time, TT), these 
      tests are not appropriate for quantifying drug levels. Therefore, specific 
      quantitative methods (LC-MS/MS as a gold standard method for all DOACs, 
      coagulometric and chromogenic assays for dabigatran, and chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assays with drug-specific calibrators for inhibitors of FXa) should only be used 
      for determination of DOACs concentration. The aim of this review is to present 
      all aspects of laboratory assessment of DOACs, including pre-analytical, 
      analytical and post-analytical factors in the overall testing process with a 
      special accent on the available specific quantitative methods for measurement of 
      DOACs in circulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation 
      were developed to be given in fixed doses without the need for the routine 
      monitoring that has hindered usage and acceptance of vitamin K antagonists. A 
      concern has emerged, however, that measurement of drug concentration or 
      anticoagulant activity might be needed to prevent excess drug concentrations, 
      which significantly increase bleeding risk. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, 
      higher-dose and lower-dose edoxaban were compared with warfarin in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation. Each regimen incorporated a 50% dose reduction in patients 
      with clinical features known to increase edoxaban drug exposure. We aim to assess 
      whether adjustment of edoxaban dose in this trial prevented excess drug 
      concentration and the risk of bleeding events. METHODS: We analysed data from the 
      randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial. We correlated edoxaban dose, 
      plasma concentration, and anti-Factor Xa (FXa) activity and compared efficacy and 
      safety outcomes with warfarin stratified by dose reduction status. Patients with 
      atrial fibrillation and at moderate to high risk of stroke were randomly assigned 
      in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive warfarin, dose adjusted to an international 
      normalised ratio of 2·0-3·0, higher-dose edoxaban (60 mg once daily), or 
      lower-dose edoxaban (30 mg once daily). Randomisation was done with use of a 
      central, 24 h, interactive, computerised response system. International 
      normalised ratio was measured using an encrypted point-of-care device. To 
      maintain masking, sham international normalised ratio values were generated for 
      patients assigned to edoxaban. Edoxaban (or placebo-edoxaban in warfarin group) 
      doses were halved at randomisation or during the trial if patients had creatinine 
      clearance 30-50 mL/min, bodyweight 60 kg or less, or concomitant medication with 
      potent P-glycoprotein interaction. Efficacy outcomes included the primary 
      endpoint of all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke, and 
      all-cause mortality. Safety outcomes included the primary safety endpoint of 
      major bleeding, fatal bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal 
      bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00781391. 
      FINDINGS: Between Nov 19, 2008 and Nov 22, 2010, 21 105 patients were recruited. 
      Patients who met clinical criteria for dose reduction at randomisation (n=5356) 
      had higher rates of stroke, bleeding, and death compared with those who did not 
      have a dose reduction (n=15 749). Edoxaban dose ranged from 15 mg to 60 mg, 
      resulting in a two-fold to three fold gradient of mean trough drug exposure 
      (16·0-48·5 ng/mL in 6780 patients with data available) and mean trough anti-FXa 
      activity (0·35-0·85 IU/mL in 2865 patients). Dose reduction decreased mean 
      exposure by 29% (from 48·5 ng/mL [SD 45·8] to 34·6 ng/mL [30·9]) and 35% (from 
      24·5 ng/mL [22·7] to 16·0 ng/mL [14·5]) and mean anti-FXa activity by 25% (from 
      0·85 IU/mL [0·76] to 0·64 IU/mL [0·54]) and 20% (from 0·44 IU/mL [0·37] to 0·35 
      IU/mL [0·28]) in the higher-dose and lower-dose regimens, respectively. Despite 
      the lower anti-FXa activity, dose reduction preserved the efficacy of edoxaban 
      compared with warfarin (stroke or systemic embolic event: higher dose 
      pinteraction=0·85, lower dose pinteraction=0·99) and provided even greater safety 
      (major bleeding: higher dose pinteraction 0·02, lower dose pinteraction=0·002). 
      INTERPRETATION: These findings validate the strategy that tailoring of the dose 
      of edoxaban on the basis of clinical factors alone achieves the dual goal of 
      preventing excess drug concentrations and helps to optimise an individual 
      patient's risk of ischaemic and bleeding events and show that the therapeutic 
      window for edoxaban is narrower for major bleeding than thromboembolism. FUNDING:

TI  - The new or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: what have we learned 
      since their debut.
PG  - 188-94
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1544159 [doi]
AB  - One of the major advances in the management of thrombosis is arguably the 
      introduction of the new non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). 
      These are small molecules, designed to directly inhibit specific steps in the 
      coagulation pathway, with dabigatran (Pradaxa), inhibiting thrombin and 
      rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixiban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Lixiana), and betrixaban 
      being factor Xa inhibitors. They have several advantages over vitamin K 
      antagonists such as warfarin, with more predictable bioavailability, fewer drug 
      interactions, and improved safety, especially intracranial hemorrhage. Yet, since 
      their debut, several issues have arisen with their increasing usage, with 
      concerns over monitoring and reversal, being predominant. Issues addressed in 
      this article include their efficacy, bleeding risk, and the recognition of a 
      vulnerable population where monitoring is needed. The current approach to 
      reversing the drug action is updated. The change in the approach to future drug 
      design is also discussed.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants: a guide for daily practice.
PG  - w14286
LID - 10.4414/smw.2016.14286 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, small oral compounds that specifically block activated 
      coagulation factor X (FXa) or thrombin (FIIa) have become alternatives to the 
      anticoagulants that had been used for several decades. As of today, these direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs) include dabigatran etexilate (thrombin inhibitor) and 
      apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban (inhibitors of FXa). While there is no doubt 
      that DOACs represent a major step forward in the management of patients with 
      venous thromboembolic disease and atrial fibrillation, new challenges have 
      arisen. They need to be addressed with the necessary pragmatism on the basis of 
      evidence. Indeed, a better understanding of the management of these 
      last-generation antithrombotics will favour safer use and increase confidence of 
      the practitioner for the prescription of these drugs. The aim of this article is 
      to present practical suggestions for the prescription and use of these drugs in 
      everyday clinical practice, based on clinical experience and recently updated 
      recommendations of the European Heart Rhythm Association and the American College 
      of Chest Physicians among other scientific organisations. We address issues such 
      as pharmacokinetics, dosing, side effects, limitations of use, drug interactions, 
      switching from and to other anticoagulants, renal function, concomitant 
      administration of antiplatelet agents and perioperative use. We also address the 
      issue of monitoring and reversal, taking advantage of the most recent development 
      in this latter area. Rather than being one additional set of recommendations, our 
      narrative review aims at assisting the practicing physician in his or her daily 
      handling of these novel anticoagulant compounds, based on frequently asked 
      questions to the authors, a group of experienced specialists in the field who 
      have, however, no commitment to issue guidelines.

TI  - Effects of the oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban on routine coagulation 
      assays, lupus anticoagulant and anti-Xa assays.
PG  - 575-583
LID - 10.1080/00365513.2018.1522664 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor for prophylaxis and treatment of 
      thromboembolic disorders. The effects on common coagulation assays are clinically 
      valuable information and in certain clinical situations a quick assessment of the 
      anticoagulant is wanted. Our aim was to investigate the effect of edoxaban on 
      routine coagulation methods and evaluate anti-Xa assays, commonly used for other 
      direct factor Xa inhibitors, for estimation of the drug concentration. Edoxaban 
      was spiked to plasma samples from healthy subjects in the concentration range 
      0-742 µg/L and analyzed using different reagents for activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). Assays for antithrombin, 
      activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant (LA) and chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assays were also included. Edoxaban displayed similar effects in vitro to other 
      oral direct Xa inhibitors. The concentration needed to double the coagulation 
      time varied between assays and reagents; 539-758 µg/L for the APTT and between 
      329 and 2505 µg/L for the PT. Edoxaban gave false high antithrombin activities in 
      assays based on Xa-inhibition. Two integrated assays for LA, both based on 
      activation with dilute Russell's viper venom, displayed different results. 
      Chromogenic anti-Xa assays displayed linear dose-response curves with edoxaban up 
      to approximately 500 µg/L. In conclusion, therapeutic concentrations of edoxaban 
      variably affect different coagulation assays, and even different reagents within 
      an assay group. In comparison with other oral Xa-inhibitors, the in vitro effects 
      of edoxaban were more similar to rivaroxaban than apixaban. For measurement of 
      edoxaban concentration in plasma, it is possible to use the chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assays.

AB  - Hospitalized medical and surgical patients encompass a group of patients in whom 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses a major concern on morbidity and mortality. 
      Recently, direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE have been 
      developed to overcome the drawbacks of the food/drug interactions and the need 
      for frequent laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments associated with the use 
      of vitamin K antagonists and the inconvenience of the subcutaneous administration 
      of low-molecular-weight heparins and fondaparinux. The novel oral anticoagulants 
      that have been tested in major clinical trials for VTE prevention in medical and 
      surgical patients are the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa 
      inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, which will be the focus of this 
      review. While the new drugs proved to be highly effective and safe in the 
      prevention of VTE following major orthopedic surgery, they failed to show a 
      favorable benefit-to-risk profile in hospitalized medical patients receiving 
      extended anticoagulation beyond the hospital stay.

TI  - New anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 515-24
LID - 10.1055/s-0029-1234147 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is already the most common clinically significant cardiac 
      arrhythmia and a common cause of stroke. Vitamin K antagonists are very effective 
      for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke but have numerous limitations that 
      limit their uptake in eligible patients with AF and reduce their effectiveness in 
      treated patients. Multiple new anticoagulants are under development as potential 
      replacements for vitamin K antagonists. Most are small synthetic molecules that 
      target factor IIa (e.g., dabigatran etexilate, AZD-0837) or factor Xa (e.g., 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, DU176b, idrabiotaparinux). These drugs have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics that allow fixed dosing without laboratory 
      monitoring, and are being compared with vitamin K antagonists or aspirin in phase 
      III clinical trials [corrected]. A new vitamin K antagonist (ATI-5923) with 
      improved pharmacological properties compared with warfarin is also being 
      evaluated in a phase III trial. None of the new agents have as yet been approved 
      for clinical use.

TI  - Development of a Rapid Qualitative Screen for Anticoagulant Presence.
PG  - 305-315
LID - 10.1093/jalm/jfad081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and fondaparinux with stable 
      pharmacokinetics are commonly used anticoagulants for outpatient care. Due to the 
      lack of monitoring requirements, drug-specific assays are not available in most 
      hospital laboratories, but drug levels are needed in some urgent/emergency 
      situations. This study describes the development of a qualitative screen for the 
      presence of DOAC or fondaparinux using coagulation tests found in most 
      laboratories. METHODS: The DOAC screen is composed of a heparin anti-Xa activity 
      assay and thrombin time (TT) assay. The STA®-Liquid-Anti-Xa assay calibrated with 
      Stago Multi Hep® and STA®-TT were run on STA-R Max® analyzers. The anti-Xa 
      activity and TT assays were repeated 5 times in samples of commercially available 
      calibrators and controls for each drug: fondaparinux, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban. Statistical analysis and correlations were performed for 
      anti-Xa activity and TT results for each drug and pooled normal plasma. RESULTS: 
      A significant correlation was found between heparin-calibrated anti-Xa levels and 
      fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixiban, and edoxaban (r2 = 0.99-1.0). Dabigatran 
      showed a strong linear correlation (r2 = 0.99) with TT. Anti-Xa levels >0.3 IU/mL 
      and TT >25 seconds were determined as cutoffs at our lab for the detection of 
      clinically relevant drug levels of factor Xa inhibitor and direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that commonly 
      available heparin anti-Xa activity and TT assays can be used to qualitatively 
      detect DOACs and fondaparinux and provides a method to establish a qualitative 
      interpretation.

TI  - Advantages and limitations of the new anticoagulants.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1111/joim.12138 [doi]
AB  - During recent years, three new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban) have been introduced to the market, probably with one more 
      anticoagulant (edoxaban) in the next 2 years. This review is not intended to 
      compare the efficacy and risks of these new agents, but rather to detail the 
      advantages and limitations. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs 
      have few drug and food interactions, predictable dose responses, and rapid onset 
      and offset, thus resulting in simplified management of the patient requiring 
      anticoagulant therapy. No routine laboratory monitoring is required. A somewhat 
      unexpected, but exciting observation involving the new anticoagulants, is the 
      uniform reduction in intracranial bleeding by one-half compared with warfarin. 
      The potential limitations of the new anticoagulants include uncertainty regarding 
      assessment of drug levels, safe drug levels for major surgery, management of 
      major bleeding, renal dependence, multiple dose regimens, adherence in the 
      absence of frequent monitoring and unknown, rare side effects that were not 
      captured in the trials. This review should clarify some of these concerns.

TI  - Pros and cons of new oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 464-70
LID - 10.1182/asheducation-2013.1.464 [doi]
AB  - The availability of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) targeting either thrombin 
      (dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the prevention 
      and treatment of thrombosis has been highly anticipated. NOACs have major 
      pharmacologic advantages over vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), including 
      rapid onset/offset of action, few drug interactions, and predictable 
      pharmacokinetics, eliminating the requirement for regular coagulation monitoring. 
      Regulatory agencies have approved several NOACs for specific indications based on 
      the results of clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety that are at 
      least as good, if not better, than warfarin (for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation and treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism) or 
      low-molecular-weight heparin, which is injectable (for initial treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee 
      arthroplasty). However, the adoption of this new therapeutic class into clinical 
      practice has been slower than expected due to several factors including concerns 
      regarding medication adherence without laboratory monitoring, uncertainty about 
      dosing in some patient populations (eg, renal dysfunction, marked extremes of 
      body weight), and higher drug costs compared with warfarin. Other issues are the 
      current absence of specific antidotes for NOACs and assays to measure drug levels 
      at most centers. The indications for NOACs on the market will expand and at least 
      one additional agent (edoxaban) will likely gain approval within the next 2 
      years. As practitioners gain familiarity with the drugs and healthcare systems 
      adapt to their use, NOAC use will increase substantially over time. Warfarin, 
      however, will continue to be an appropriate anticoagulant choice for many 
      patients.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of dronedarone from clinical trials to real-world evidence: 
      implications for its use in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1764-1775
LID - 10.1093/europace/euz193 [doi]
AB  - Efficacy and safety of dronedarone was shown in the ATHENA trial for paroxysmal 
      or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Further trials revealed safety 
      concerns in patients with heart failure and permanent AF. This review summarizes 
      insights from recent real-world studies and meta-analyses, including reports on 
      efficacy, with focus on liver safety, mortality risk in patients with 
      paroxysmal/persistent AF, and interactions of dronedarone with direct oral 
      anticoagulants. Reports of rapidly progressing liver failure in 
      dronedarone-prescribed patients in 2011 led to regulatory cautions about 
      potential liver toxicity. Recent real-world evidence suggests dronedarone liver 
      safety profile is similar to other antiarrhythmics and liver toxicity could be 
      equally common with many Class III antiarrhythmics. Dronedarone safety concerns 
      (increased mortality in patients with permanent AF) were raised based on 
      randomized controlled trials (RCT) (ANDROMEDA and PALLAS), but comedication with 
      digoxin may have increased the mortality rates in PALLAS, considering the 
      dronedarone-digoxin pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction. Real-world data on 
      apixaban-dronedarone interactions and edoxaban RCT observations suggest no 
      significant safety risks for these drug combinations. Median trough plasma 
      concentrations of dabigatran 110 mg during concomitant use with dronedarone are 
      at acceptable levels, while PK data on the rivaroxaban-dronedarone interaction 
      are unavailable. In RCTs and real-world studies, dronedarone significantly 
      reduces AF burden and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and demonstrates a low 
      risk for proarrhythmia in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. The concerns 
      on liver safety must be balanced against the significant reduction in 
      hospitalizations in patients with non-permanent AF and low risk for 
      proarrhythmias following dronedarone treatment.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Obesity and Atrial Fibrillation: 
      Position Paper of Italian National Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO).
LID - 10.3390/jcm10184185 [doi]
LID - 4185
AB  - The use of the direct oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban (DOACs) offers some major advantages over warfarin and other vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs). One advantage is the possibility to use a fixed dose in 
      normal-weight patients, overweight patients and patients with obesity. However, 
      the "one size fits all" strategy raised a concern regarding the possibility to 
      undertreat patients with a high body mass index. No randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) have ever compared VKAs and DOACs in this population. We analyzed data 
      from the literature on DOAC pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, results from 
      the four pivotal phase III trials on non-valvular atrial fibrillation, 
      retrospective observational studies and metanalyses. While we are aware of the 
      limitation imposed by the absence of specific RCTs, we propose the position of 
      the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) on the use of DOACs in 
      patients with obesity based on the existing evidence.

TI  - [New oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in nephrology].
LID - gin/33.4.12 [pii]
AB  - The new or direct oral anticoagulants [new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOAC)] were launched in the Italian market in 2013. Although 
      these compounds share common pharmacological indications with vitamin K 
      antagonists (warfarin or acenocumarol), they have different mechanisms of action, 
      do not require a constant anticoagulant monitoring but are more efficacious and 
      safer than vitamin K antagonists. The use of these molecules (Dabigatran, 
      Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Betrixaban, Edoxaban) is constantly rising in daily 
      practice. However, while available data suggest that NOAC/DOAC use is safe, 
      dosage should be adjusted based on renal or liver function. It should be 
      acknowledged that commonly available blood tests [Prothrombin Time (PT) and 
      partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] are not indicated to monitor the anticoagulant 
      activity of these compounds. With the exception of dabigatran, we currently lack 
      of an antidote to reverse the anticoagulant effect of NOAC/DOAC. We herein review 
      available evidence on NOAC/DOAC pharmacokinetic, risk factors for bleeding, 
      interventions to reverse the anticoagulant activity in case of hemorrhages or 
      need of urgent surgery and/or NOAC/DOAC overdose or side effects.

AB  - Approximately 900,000 people are affected by some sort of venous thromboembolic 
      (VTE) event every year in the United States. VTE diagnosis used to mean treatment 
      with medications that required routine lab monitoring for safety and efficacy. 
      Activated factor X (FXa) inhibition has emerged as a convenient pathway for 
      management of VTE and currently three FXa inhibitors are available for 
      anticoagulation management - rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Continued 
      development of medications utilizing this pathway may offer advantages via novel 
      pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties that may minimize the adverse 
      effects associated with traditional anticoagulant therapy. This review summarizes 
      the available information regarding pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and early 
      safety and efficacy data for three factor Xa inhibitors being developed - 
      darexaban, betrixaban and nokxaban. The studies reviewed in this article suggests 
      that three newer agents possess the potential for promise based on early phase I 
      and II trials.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.25579 [doi]
AB  - Oral anticoagulants (OAs) are the recommended drugs to prevent cardiovascular 
      events and recurrence in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and cardioembolic 
      stroke. We conducted a literature search to review the current state of OAs 
      pharmacogenomics, focusing on Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAs) in patients 
      treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). 
      VKAs: Warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione and phenprocoumon have long been used, 
      but their interindividual variability and narrow therapeutic/safety ratio makes 
      their dosage difficult. GWAs have been useful in finding genetic variants 
      associated with VKAs response. The main genes involved in VKAs pharmacogenetics 
      are: VKORC1, CYP2C19 and CYP4F2. Variants in these genes have been included in 
      pharmacogenetic algorithms to predict the VKAs dose individually in each patient 
      depending on their genotype and clinical variables. DOACs: Dabigatran, apixaban, 
      rivaroxaban and edoxaban have been approved for patients with AF. They have 
      stable pharmacokinetics and do not require routine blood checks, thus avoiding 
      most of the drawbacks of VKAs. Except for a GWAs performed in patients treated 
      with dabigatran, there is no Genome Wide pharmacogenomics data for DOACs. 
      Pharmacogenomics could be useful to predict the better clinical response and 
      avoid adverse events in patients treated with anticoagulants, identifying the 
      most appropriate anticoagulant drug for each patient. Current pharmacogenomics 
      data show that the polymorphisms affecting VKAs or DOACs are different, 
      concluding that personalized medicine based on pharmacogenomics could be 
      possible. However, more studies are required to implement personalized medicine 
      in clinical practice with OA and based on pharmacogenetics of DOACs.

TI  - Drug-drug interaction studies of cardiovascular drugs involving P-glycoprotein, 
      an efflux transporter, on the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban, an oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor.
PG  - 331-42
LID - 10.1007/s40256-013-0029-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is in development for 
      thromboprophylaxis, including prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux 
      transporter, modulates absorption and excretion of xenobiotics. Edoxaban is a 
      P-gp substrate, and several cardiovascular (CV) drugs have the potential to 
      inhibit P-gp and increase drug exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential 
      pharmacokinetic interactions of edoxaban and 6 cardiovascular drugs used in the 
      management of AF and known P-gp substrates/inhibitors. METHODS: Drug-drug 
      interaction studies with edoxaban and CV drugs with known P-gp 
      substrate/inhibitor potential were conducted in healthy subjects. In 4 crossover, 
      2-period, 2-treatment studies, subjects received edoxaban 60 mg alone and 
      coadministered with quinidine 300 mg (n = 42), verapamil 240 mg (n = 34), 
      atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 32), or dronedarone 400 mg (n = 34). Additionally, 
      edoxaban 60 mg alone and coadministered with amiodarone 400 mg (n = 30) or 
      digoxin 0.25 mg (n = 48) was evaluated in a single-sequence study and 2-cohort 
      study, respectively. RESULTS: Edoxaban exposure measured as area under the curve 
      increased for concomitant administration of edoxaban with quinidine (76.7 %), 
      verapamil (52.7 %), amiodarone (39.8 %), and dronedarone (84.5 %), and exposure 
      measured as 24-h concentrations for quinidine (11.8 %), verapamil (29.1 %), and 
      dronedarone (157.6 %) also increased. Administration of edoxaban with amiodarone 
      decreased the 24-h concentration for edoxaban by 25.7 %. Concomitant 
      administration with digoxin or atorvastatin had minimal effects on edoxaban 
      exposure. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of the P-gp inhibitors quinidine, 
      verapamil, and dronedarone increased edoxaban exposure. Modest/minimal effects 
      were observed for amiodarone, atorvastatin, and digoxin.

TI  - Real-world experience with edoxaban for anticoagulation in children at risk for 
      coronary artery thrombosis.
PG  - 870-875
LID - 10.1017/S1047951123003761 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants have the potential to improve care in 
      children requiring chronic anticoagulation. Edoxaban has favourable 
      pharmacokinetics that could benefit younger patients but data on long-term safety 
      and efficacy for specific paediatric indications are lacking. STUDY AIMS: We 
      present a single-centre experience using edoxaban in children who require chronic 
      anticoagulation for large coronary artery aneurysms secondary to Kawasaki 
      disease. METHODS: Weight-based dosing of once-daily oral edoxaban was offered as 
      alternative to standard anticoagulation for patients aged 1-18 years. Chart 
      review was performed for a median follow-up period of 49 months on edoxaban. 
      Steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban were also 
      explored. RESULTS: Sixteen patients on chronic therapy with edoxaban were 
      included. No major bleeding events were reported. Two patients experienced 
      coronary artery thrombosis after 23 and 38 months on edoxaban, 7 and 11 years 
      after diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, respectively. This predicts 70% event-free 
      rate at 12 years from diagnosis. Area under the curve estimates over the dosing 
      interval of 24 hours were similar to those reported in adults. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Edoxaban use is feasible and well-tolerated for long-term use in paediatric 
      population. We suggest appropriate exposure using weight-based once-daily dosing 
      strategy that may be comparable to standard-of-care anticoagulation in prevention 
      of coronary artery thrombosis. Larger studies are needed to evaluate long-term 
      safety and efficacy of edoxaban in this population.

TI  - Use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants in solid organ transplantation: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 28-43
LID - 10.1002/phar.2485 [doi]
AB  - The use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has increased secondary to 
      the mounting evidence for comparable efficacy and potentially superior safety to 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the general population. However, insufficient 
      data regarding DOAC use in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and numerous 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations limit their use in this highly 
      selected patient population. A systematic review of recent clinical evidence on 
      the safety and efficacy of DOACs compared to VKAs in SOT recipients was 
      conducted. Additional considerations including transplant-specific strategies for 
      DOAC reversal and common pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic concerns were also 
      reviewed. Although current evidence is limited to single-center retrospective 
      analyses, DOACs, especially apixaban, appear to be a safe and effective 
      alternative to VKAs for SOT recipients with stable graft function and without 
      drug-drug interactions. Reliable data on DOAC reversal at the time of transplant 
      surgery are lacking, and clinicians should consider idarucizumab, andexanet alfa, 
      and other non-specific reversal agents on an individual patient basis. There is 
      no evidence supporting deviations from the Food and Drug Administration labeling 
      recommendations for DOAC dosing in the setting of drug-drug interactions, 
      obesity, and renal function, especially in patients on hemodialysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulant therapy in pediatric patients remains an issue and 
      safer therapies, such as direct oral anticoagulants could overcome the 
      limitations of conventional anticoagulant treatments in this population. 
      Edoxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, is used for the prevention and treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism. Due to its pharmacokinetic characteristics, edoxaban is a 
      promising candidate molecule for children. This study compared edoxaban in vitro 
      effect in children and adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were 
      prospectively collected from 87 adults and 97 children (n = 12: <2 year-old; 
      n = 8: 2-4 year-old; n = 9: 5-7 year-old; n = 14: 8-9 year-old; n = 10: 
      10-13 year-old; n = 15: 14-15 year-old; and n = 29: 16-18 year-old). Plasma 
      samples were supplemented in vitro with edoxaban to a final concentration of 50, 
      150 or 300 ng/mL, and then edoxaban effect on prothrombin time (PT), activated 
      partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen (Clauss assay), specific 
      anti-factor Xa activity and thrombin generation assay (TGA) (with 5pM tissue 
      factor and 4 nM phospholipids) was evaluated. RESULTS: PT, aPTT, and specific 
      anti-Xa activity exhibited similar dose-dependent responses to edoxaban in the 
      different age groups. The reduction of thrombin peak, the most edoxaban-sensitive 
      TGA parameter, was similar in adults and children, but for the youngest group 
      (<2 year-old) where the peak value reduction (median [Q1-Q3]) was higher than in 
      adults (51% [44-59] versus 40% [32-46], p < 0.01; 74% [63-80] versus 65% [58-70], 
      p < 0.05; and 84% [73-88] versus 76% [70-80], p < 0.05 for 50, 150 and 300 ng/mL 
      edoxaban, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban in vitro effect are comparable in 
      children and adults except in the <2-year-old group.

TI  - Interactions between antiepileptic drugs and direct oral anticoagulants for 
      primary and secondary stroke prevention.
PG  - 359-376
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2024.2352466 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are the guideline-recommended 
      therapy for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous 
      thromboembolism. Since approximately 10% of patients using antiepileptic drugs 
      (AED) also receive DOAC, aim of this review is to summarize data about drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) of DOAC with AED by using data from PubMed until December 
      2023. AREAS COVERED: Of 49 AED, only 16 have been investigated regarding DDI with 
      DOAC by case reports or observational studies. No increased risk for stroke was 
      reported only for topiramate, zonisamide, pregabalin, and gabapentin, whereas for 
      the remaining 12 AED conflicting results regarding the risk for stroke and 
      bleeding were found. Further 16 AED have the potential for pharmacodynamic or 
      pharmacokinetic DDI, but no data regarding DOAC are available. For the remaining 
      17 AED it is unknown if they have DDI with DOAC. EXPERT OPINION: Knowledge about 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic DDI of AED and DOAC is limited and frequently 
      restricted to in vitro and in vivo findings. Since no data about DDI with DOAC 
      are available for 67% of AED and an increasing number of patients have a combined 
      medication of DOAC and AED, there is an urgent need for research on this topic.

TI  - Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants in patients at extremes of body weight: a 
      review of pharmacological considerations and clinical implications.
PG  - e31-e41
LID - 10.1055/s-0043-1776989 [doi]
AB  - Patients at extremes of body weight are underrepresented in randomized controlled 
      trials of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Therefore, their optimal 
      anticoagulant treatment remains a topic of debate. The aim of this narrative 
      review is to summarize the evidence on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profile of DOACs for treating patients at extremes of body weight in venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) and in the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). A literature search was conducted in the 
      main bibliographic databases, and the most relevant reviews and original articles 
      on the topic were selected. Although data in these patient groups are limited, 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban show a favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profile in obese VTE treatment and NVAF patients and, in the case of apixaban, 
      also in underweight patients. In particular, these drugs demonstrated comparable 
      efficacy and safety to standard therapy. Very few data were available for 
      dabigatran and edoxaban; the latter drug was safer at a lower dose, mainly in 
      underweight patients. Our findings are in line with the last International 
      Society of Haemostasis and Thrombosis position paper and European Heart Rhythm 
      Association 2021 practical guide, suggesting the use of apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      in morbidly obese patients (>120 kg or body mass index ≥40 kg/m (2) ) and the 
      reduced dosage of edoxaban in low-weight patients. Future studies should focus on 
      large populations of patients at extremes of body weights to acquire more 
      clinical and pharmacokinetic evidence on all available DOACs, especially those 
      currently less investigated.

      Clinical Practice Guidelines for Stroke.
PG  - 210-5

AB  - Cardioembolic stroke related to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is associated 
      with a high recurrence rate and high mortality and morbidity. In this population, 
      therefore, optimal anticoagulant therapy is required to prevent the occurrence of 
      second stroke. Oral anticoagulant, warfarin has been traditionally used, but it 
      is greatly limited by its narrow efficacy window, complex pharmacokinetics, and 
      multiple drug interactions, thus requiring frequent blood monitoring. Recently, 
      oral anticoagulants targeted for a specific coagulation component have been newly 
      developed and tested in large clinical trials. Dabigatran, direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, inhibitors of factor Xa 
      harbor great merits of rapid action time, short half-life, stable plasma 
      concentration, and little drug interaction. Recently, large randomized clinical 
      trials and meta-analyses have been published to show the efficacy and safety of 
      the new oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin. Based on the results from 
      recent clinical trials, we revised recommendations to apply optimal anticoagulant 
      therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke or 
      transient ischemic attack.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a microdosed cocktail of three direct oral anticoagulants in 
      children with congenital heart defects: study protocol for a single-centre 
      clinical trial (DOAC-Child).
LID - 10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001662 [doi]
LID - e001662
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are direct inhibitors of 
      coagulation factor Xa and are frequently used in adults for different indications 
      such as deep vein thrombosis or non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Paediatric 
      patients might benefit as well from DOACs because the simplicity and convenience 
      of their use is likely to decrease physical and psychological stress related to 
      invasive procedures associated with phenprocoumon and heparin therapy. Thus, it 
      is expected that the future use of DOACs will ultimately improve compliance and 
      overall safety of anticoagulant therapies in paediatric populations. To assure 
      safe and effective use the clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      these drugs need to be evaluated in children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is 
      a single-centre, open-label, clinical trial in a paediatric population with 
      non-cyanotic congenital heart defects. After having obtained informed consent 
      from the parents, each participant will receive a single oral administration of a 
      drinkable solution of a microdose cocktail of three FXa inhibitors consisting of 
      apixaban (12.5 µg), rivaroxaban (12.5 µg), edoxaban (50 µg), plus a microdose of 
      the two probe drugs midazolam (10 µg) and yohimbine (25 µg). Serial blood samples 
      (n=up to 20) will be collected at specified time points before and up to 25 hours 
      after cocktail administration. The primary PK endpoint will be the area under the 
      plasma concentration time curve of apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Secondary 
      PK outcomes will be C(max), t(max), t(1/2), Cl/F and V(ss)/F. Safety and 
      tolerability of the microdose cocktail will be evaluated as well by a collection 
      of adverse events. ETHICS: This study has been approved by the responsible Ethics 
      Committee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University. DISSEMINATION: Study 
      results will be presented at international scientific meetings and published in 
      peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EudraCT 2019-001759-38 16,

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug Monitoring of Direct-Acting Oral 
      Anticoagulants: Where Do We Stand?
PG  - 180-191
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000594 [doi]
AB  - For decades, oral anticoagulation has been based on vitamin K antagonist such as 
      warfarin, which requires pharmacodynamic (PD) drug monitoring to guide the 
      therapy. The drug effect is measured by the clotting test prothrombin time and 
      expressed as international normalized ratio. New direct oral anticoagulants are 
      increasingly used in fixed-dose regimens but are licensed without any therapy 
      monitoring. However, extensive clinical experiences have demonstrated that 
      interindividual variations in the response to the therapy with direct oral 
      anticoagulants do exist. In situations such as bleeding or thrombosis, 
      therapeutic drug monitoring could be useful. Unfortunately, global coagulation 
      assays such as the prothrombin time or the activated partial thrombin time are 
      not suitable for this purpose. To measure drug concentrations, more specific 
      coagulation test can be used if they are externally calibrated with the 
      respective drugs. For the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, a 
      calibrated diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time can be used, whereas for 
      anti-factor Xa drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban, 
      calibrated anti-factor Xa assays are appropriate. However, the gold standard to 
      measure drug concentrations is LC-MS/MS. The variation in bleeding and thrombotic 
      events noted with both drug classes under fixed-dose conditions suggests 
      additional interindividual PD differences. Therefore, PD monitoring to 
      individualize the therapy may be an option. For dabigatran, this is the 
      inhibition of thrombin formation and for anti-factor Xa drugs, the inhibition of 
      factor Xa activity, which can be followed using the functional assays mentioned 
      above but without calibration. Alternatively, thrombin generation assays have 
      been proposed for both drug classes. So far, not many clinical data have been 
      published about the potentially beneficial effects of PD monitoring for dose 
      individualization. The assay platforms for PD monitoring are present in many 
      clinical laboratories, but efforts are needed to validate and standardize 
      available assays to perform appropriate clinical trials.

TI  - Comparison of a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, with dalteparin and 
      ximelagatran: a randomised controlled trial in healthy elderly adults.
PG  - e286-93
LID - 10.1016/j.thromres.2010.07.015 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Edoxaban (the free base of DU-176b) is a new, oral direct Factor Xa 
      inhibitor. This is the first study to compare the hemostatic response to 
      edoxaban, ximelagatran, and dalteparin in healthy, elderly adults. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 40 adults (65-75 
      years), were randomised to: oral edoxaban (60 mg, twice-daily, 7 doses), 
      subcutaneous dalteparin (5000 IU, once-daily, 4 doses), oral ximelagatran (24 mg, 
      twice-daily, 7 doses) or no drug. Blood samples were taken before, and 1.5, 4, 
      12, 24, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, and 144 hours after, the first dose. The primary 
      outcomes were changes in thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment 1+2 
      and D-dimer, and adverse events. Additional biomarkers of coagulation, and 
      endothelial cell and platelet activation were compared (ANOVA). RESULTS: All 
      subjects completed the study. Inhibition of thrombin generation lag time, peak, 
      and constant velocity index were significantly greater, and extended for a longer 
      period of time, following edoxaban administration, compared with dalteparin. We 
      found that the traditional assay for anti-FXa activity was not appropriate for 
      the new anticoagulants. Biomarker changes following edoxaban administration 
      (including prolongation of prothrombin time) reflected inhibition of Factor Xa; 
      there was no effect on platelet, tissue factor or endothelial activation. There 
      were no clinically significant changes in primary outcomes. No serious adverse 
      events were reported. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of edoxaban resulted in 
      effective Factor Xa and TG inhibition, and was well-tolerated. Studies are needed 
      to confirm edoxaban (60 mg daily) use in clinical practice. SPONSORSHIP: Daiichi

TI  - The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and extremes of body 
      weight-a systematic literature review.
PG  - 565-572
LID - 10.1007/s00392-017-1102-5 [doi]
AB  - The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) exert their 
      anticoagulant effect closely related to their plasma concentrations. Since their 
      distribution volume is related to body weight (and its correlates, i.e., surface 
      area and body mass index, BMI), extremes in body weight may affect their efficacy 
      or safety. Four NOACs are currently available for long-term use, with few 
      exceptions, in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism: the direct 
      thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, and the factor (F) Xa inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Experience in patients with low (<50 kg) or 
      extremely high (>150 kg) body weight is still quite limited, as such patients 
      were rare in registration trials and sometimes directly excluded. In general, 
      increased bleeding and higher mortality rates are observed in patients 
      weighing <50 kg compared with patients weighing 50-100 kg. This may however also 
      be explained by the presence of underlying conditions such as cancer. At the 
      opposite end of the spectrum of body weight, lower antithrombotic efficacy may 
      occur, perhaps due to the dilutional effect of a higher distribution volume. In 
      this article, we review the pertinent literature and analyze the effects of low 
      or high body weight on anticoagulant activity and clinical outcomes of the NOACs, 
      their dose recommendations, and areas of uncertainty.

TI  - Edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation in relation to the 
      risk of stroke: A secondary analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The efficacy and safety of the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban 
      compared to warfarin stratified by CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores have not been 
      described. METHODS: The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial randomized patients with atrial 
      fibrillation to once-daily edoxaban or warfarin. We classified patients based on 
      CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score and compared pharmacokinetics (edoxaban concentration), 
      pharmacodynamics (anti-factor Xa [FXa] with edoxaban, time-in-therapeutic range 
      for warfarin), efficacy (stroke or systemic embolism [SSE]), safety (major 
      bleeding [MB], intracranial hemorrhage), and cardiovascular mortality, for the 
      approved edoxaban regimen vs warfarin. RESULTS: The distribution CHA(2)DS(2)VASc 
      score were:≤3, N = 4159 (29.6%); 4, N = 4066 (28.9%); 5, N = 3165 (22.5%); and 
      ≥6, N = 2681 (19.1%). Increasing rates of SSE (1.05 to 2.99%/year) and MB (2.27 
      to 4.66%/year) were observed in the warfarin arm as the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score 
      increased. The hazard ratios per unit increase of CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score were 1.29 
      (1.21-1.38) and 1.26 (1.17-1.36) for SSE, and 1.20 (1.13-1.27) and 1.19 
      (1.12-1.27) for MB, with warfarin and edoxaban, respectively. Time-in-therapeutic 
      range in warfarin-treated patients was similar and high (median 68%-69%) across 
      CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores, whereas edoxaban trough concentration, exogenous anti-FXa 
      activity and %inhibition of endogenous FXa were higher at increasing 
      CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores. Edoxaban reduced SSE, MB, intracranial hemorrhage, and 
      cardiovascular mortality vs warfarin to a similar degree across the range of 
      CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores (P-int = 0.90, 0.96, 0.21, and 0.37, respectively). 
      Because of higher event rates the number of events prevented with edoxaban tended 
      to be greater in patients with higher CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores. CONCLUSION: The 
      benefit and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin is maintained across 
      CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores. While the relative risk reductions remain similar, 
      edoxaban provides incrementally larger absolute reductions in outcomes over 
      warfarin in patients with higher CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores.

TI  - Anticoagulation strategies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a 
      comprehensive review of current literature.
PG  - 3691-3699
LID - 10.1097/MS9.0000000000003364 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) significantly increases stroke risk and hence requires 
      anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke. This review discusses strategies of 
      anticoagulation, including the paradigm shift from traditional vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. VKAs are effective but require 
      regular monitoring of international normalized ratio and also pose challenges 
      because of their drug and dietary interactions. In contrast, DOACs provide 
      predictable pharmacokinetics, fewer interactions, and no requirement for routine 
      monitoring, and their use is increasingly favored in clinical practice. The 
      review puts an emphasis on the considerations that are patient-specific when 
      choosing an anticoagulant agent, including age, renal function, and associated 
      diseases; stroke risk or risk factors for bleeding; and it explains how tools 
      such as the use of CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores can be relevant for assessing 
      stroke and bleeding risk, respectively. Also, it is explored that the use of 
      emerging therapies like factor XI inhibitors and combinations such as dual 
      antiplatelet therapy with anticoagulants has the potential to provide maximum 
      stroke prevention but fewer bleeding complications. This review evaluated the 
      effect of reversal agents for anticoagulants that may act as a safety measure 
      during instances of serious bleeding. In summary, AF anticoagulation has to be 
      individually tailored based on patient characteristics and meticulous reading of 
      clinical guidelines. As much as DOACs present a tremendous step forward in stroke 
      prevention related to AF, future studies and emerging treatments show promise to 
      further optimize therapeutic outcomes.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients with 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: Understanding Differences and Similarities.
PG  - 1627-44
LID - 10.1007/s40265-015-0452-4 [doi]
AB  - The presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac 
      arrhythmia, significantly increases the risk for stroke. Current guidelines 
      recommend that the vitamin K antagonist warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs), such as the approved direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the 
      approved direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, should 
      be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular AF at risk for stroke 
      or systemic embolic events (SEE). Warfarin, the mainstay of stroke prevention in 
      AF, increases the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, warfarin therapy comes 
      with several limitations including frequent monitoring and the need for dose 
      adjustments, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the 
      potential for significant drug-drug and food-drug interactions. The DOACs were 
      developed to overcome these limitations while maintaining or surpassing 
      warfarin's efficacy and safety profiles. All four DOACs have similar or better 
      efficacy and safety compared with warfarin and are therefore valuable 
      alternatives for the prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with nonvalvular 
      AF. Understanding the subtle differences in the DOACs' pharmacology, phase 3 
      study designs, and trial outcomes will allow for a more tailored approach in 
      selecting the right oral anticoagulant for each patient.

TI  - Novel Thiourea and Oxime Ether Isosteviol-Based Anticoagulants: MD Simulation and 
      ADMET Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/ph17020163 [doi]
LID - 163
AB  - Activated blood coagulation factor X (FXa) plays a critical initiation step of 
      the blood-coagulation pathway and is considered a desirable target for 
      anticoagulant drug development. It is reversibly inhibited by nonvitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, 
      and rivaroxaban. Thrombosis is extremely common and is one of the leading causes 
      of death in developed countries. In previous studies, novel thiourea and oxime 
      ether isosteviol derivatives as FXa inhibitors were designed through a 
      combination of QSAR studies and molecular docking. In the present contribution, 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for 100 ns to assess binding 
      structures previously predicted by docking and furnish additional information. 
      Moreover, three thiourea- and six oxime ether-designed isosteviol analogs were 
      then examined for their drug-like and ADMET properties. MD simulations 
      demonstrated that four out of the nine investigated isosteviol derivatives, i.e., 
      one thiourea and three oxime ether ISV analogs, form stable complexes with FXa. 
      These derivatives interact with FXa in a manner similar to Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs like edoxaban and betrixaban, indicating 
      their potential to inhibit factor Xa activity. One of these derivatives, E24, 
      displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties, positioning it as the most 
      promising drug candidate. This, along with the other three derivatives, can 
      undergo further chemical synthesis and bioassessment.

TI  - Development of Trypsin-Like Serine Protease Inhibitors as Therapeutic Agents: 
      Opportunities, Challenges, and their Unique Structure-Based Rationales.
PG  - 1506-29
AB  - There has been a revolution in the development of effective, small-molecule 
      anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. Numerous trypsin-like serine proteases 
      have been under active pursuit as therapeutic targets. Important examples include 
      thrombin, factor VIIa, factor Xa, and β-tryptase with indications ranging from 
      thrombosis and inflammation to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD). Trypsin-like serine proteases exhibit a highly similar tertiary folding 
      pattern, especially for the region near the substrate binding pocket that 
      includes the conserved catalytic triad consisting of histidine 57, aspartic acid 
      102, and serine 195. A rich collection of X-ray structures for many trypsin-like 
      serine proteases is available, which greatly facilitated the optimization of 
      small organic inhibitors as therapeutic agents. The present review surveyed those 
      inhibitors disclosed in peer-reviewed scientific journals and patent publications 
      with a special focus on structural features and protein-inhibitor interactions 
      that implicated the inhibitor optimization process. The role played by the 
      residue 190 of trypsin-like serine proteases is critical. While many inhibitors 
      without a basic group have progressed into the clinic for ones with alanine 190, 
      the task for those with serine 190 remains extremely challenging, if not 
      impossible. In addition to warfarin, heparin, and low molecular weight heparins 
      (LMWHs), treatment options have expanded with the development and approval of the 
      new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The NOACs are superior to vitamin K antagonists 
      in terms of rapid onset, pharmacokinetics, drug/food interactions, and regular 
      coagulation monitoring; but one serious drawback is the lack of an effective 
      antidote at this time. Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban 
      (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. 
      FDA and are in current clinical practice. These drugs bind to the active site of 
      factor Xa (fXa) which prevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. In 
      addition, dabigatran etexikate (Pradaxa), the direct thrombin inhibitor (fIIa) is 
      also now widely prescribed.

TI  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation: safety issues in the elderly.
PG  - 1309-1327
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2020.1842191 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are 
      increasingly used for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). Since NOACs are predominantly used in the elderly with AF at high risk for 
      stroke and bleeding and with comorbidities requiring polypharmacy, it is 
      important to assess their safety and efficacy in this population. AREAS COVERED: 
      We review changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed with 
      senescence and the effect on NOACs and drug and food interactions. We also 
      provide an update on challenges related to NOAC use in situations that increases 
      the risk for bleeding or require temporary discontinuation and address practical 
      issues in the elderly AF patients managed on NOACs. Clinical studies and trials 
      with cardiovascular outcomes reported from January 1990 to August 2020 were 
      identified through the Medline database using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and 
      EMBASE database. EXPERT OPINION: NOACs are highly effective in preventing stroke 
      in AF patients with non-inferior or superior efficacy to warfarin, with reduced 
      risk of major bleeding. However, in the older-elderly, evidence comes mainly from 
      observational studies or extrapolation from studies in populations with minimal 
      functional limitations or comorbidities. The high upfront cost and out-of-pocket 
      expense for copayment or deductibles also limit the use of this effective therapy 
      in a substantial number of patients. The cost reduction may further improve 
      long-term use for NOACs in stroke prevention in elderly patients with AF.

TI  - Responses of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time to 
      edoxaban in Japanese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: 
      characteristics of representative reagents in Japan (CVI ARO 7).
PG  - 2011-2020
LID - 10.1007/s00380-019-01438-6 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the distribution of plasma concentration 
      of edoxaban (PC-Ed) with their 90% interval (on therapy range) and its 
      correlation with anticoagulation markers in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF). Consecutive 97 NVAF patients under edoxaban therapy were 
      evaluated (60/30 mg dose, n = 48/49; men/women, n = 71/26; age, 69 years). 
      CHADS(2) score 0, 1, and ≥ 2 were 27%, 44%, and 29%, respectively. The mean (90% 
      interval) of PC-Ed by LC-MS/MS was 194.3 (49.4-345.3) and 17.0 (4.8-40.7) ng/mL 
      at peak (2-4 h post-dose) and trough (pre-dose), respectively. Correlation of 
      prothrombin time (PT) with PC-Ed was higher than that of activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT). Among 6 PT reagents, Coagupia PT-N and Simplastin 
      Excel S (both PT reagents) showed the highest predictive capability for the upper 
      outlier of PC-Ed at peak and trough. Among 4 aPTT reagents, only Thrombocheck 
      APTT measured at peak had a significant predictive capability. When using PT 
      reagents, both peak and trough sampling showed a similar predictive capability 
      for the upper outliers of PC-Ed with a high sensitivity, but a relatively low 
      specificity. We demonstrated the distributions of plasma concentration, PT with 6 
      reagents, and aPTT with 4 reagents under edoxaban therapy in Japanese patients 
      with NVAF, showing their 90% intervals. For predicting the upper outlier of 
      PC-Ed, PT was more sensitive compared with aPTT, whereas predicting capability 
      for the outliers of PC-Ed was mostly similar between peak and trough samplings 
      among PT reagents (UMIN 000032492).

TI  - Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 385-91
LID - 10.1038/nrcardio.2012.19 [doi]
AB  - Safe and effective stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial as 
      the number of patients with this condition continues to increase. Several novel 
      oral anticoagulants are being developed as replacements for warfarin for this 
      indication. Direct factor Xa inhibitors comprise the largest class of oral 
      anticoagulants in development; the inhibition of factor Xa is recognized to be a 
      promising target for therapeutic anticoagulation, partly because of its location 
      in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are 
      small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the 
      active site of factor Xa. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles 
      vary, which might allow patient-specific therapy. Several of these agents have 
      been tested in clinical trials for various indications, including AF, with 
      favorable results. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban have shown superiority 
      and noninferiority, respectively, to warfarin in phase III clinical trials for 
      stroke prevention in AF. These agents have also been shown to be safe in terms of 
      bleeding risk. Despite these advantages, factor Xa inhibitors have several 
      characteristics, such as potential interactions with other drugs (inhibitors of 
      cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein) and the inability to reverse their 
      anticoagulant effects, as well as concerns about poor patient compliance, which 
      must be considered when initiating patients on a novel factor Xa inhibitor.

TI  - Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: A Clinical Perspective on Trials of the 
      Novel Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 201-14
LID - 10.1007/s10557-015-6632-3 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disturbance; its incidence 
      increases with age, and it is also an independent risk factor for stroke. 
      Anticoagulation has been proven as the most effective way to reduce the risk of 
      stroke in patients with AF, and vitamin K antagonists have been used for decades 
      as the gold standard treatment. Vitamin K antagonists have a narrow therapeutic 
      window in addition to variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and they 
      frequently interact with food and other drugs, requiring coagulation monitoring 
      to ensure balance between safety and efficacy. The novel oral anticoagulants 
      (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban selectively target either 
      thrombin or Factor Xa and have predictable pharmacologic profiles, removing the 
      need for routine coagulation monitoring. This article summarizes phase III data 
      in patient subtypes and discusses controversies surrounding AF management with 
      these agents. Results indicate that NOACs in non-valvular AF have an overall 
      improved efficacy-safety profile compared with warfarin. Significantly fewer 
      fatal bleeding events were observed in patients randomized to rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, or edoxaban compared with those on warfarin, and significant reductions 
      in the incidence of life-threatening bleeding were observed in patients 
      randomized to dabigatran. All four pivotal trials testing the NOACs against 
      warfarin showed significantly lower rates of intracranial bleeding in patients 
      administered NOACs. These results suggest that wider use of NOACs has the 
      potential to improve outcomes for most patients with AF.

TI  - New frontiers in anticoagulation: non vitamin-K oral anticoagulants in stroke 
      prevention.
PG  - 539-552
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2017.1268053 [doi]
AB  - Non vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are direct and specific inhibitors of 
      the coagulation factors IIa (dabigatran) and Xa (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) 
      which share many pharmacokinetic properties. However, indications are lacking 
      regarding the use of NOACs during thrombolysis, surgery and bleeding events. 
      Areas covered: In this paper, the authors retrospectively analyzed the relevant 
      literature on the NOACs using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Expert 
      commentary: Although warfarin is effective in cardioembolic stroke prevention, 
      easier handling and more favorable risk-benefit profile often render NOACs a more 
      preferable therapy choice for neurologists. New evidences have suggested their 
      use in treatment of elderly people, in patients with renal insufficiency or with 
      antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In addition, the use of antidotes, which 
      rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effect of the NOACs, could be useful in 
      bleeding, during emergency procedures, or in case of overdose.

TI  - [Anticoagulation in geriatric patients with atrial fibrillation : With what and

PG  - 214-221
LID - 10.1007/s00059-017-4665-z [doi]
AB  - Based on established risk scores, such as the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, the 
      indications for oral anticoagulation are given for patients over 65 years old 
      with atrial fibrillation and even more so for patients over 75 years old. Before 
      beginning anticoagulation a geriatric assessment for evaluation of the cognitive 
      ability, the activities of daily living and the risk of falling should be made 
      because of the known complications of anticoagulation. Geriatric patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasingly being treated with 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) to prevent ischemic stroke. 
      The European Society for Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF 
      recommended NOACs as the preferred treatment and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) only 
      as an alternative option. Meanwhile, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban as 
      factor Xa inhibitors and dabigatran as a thrombin inhibitor, are more commonly 
      used in clinical practice in patients with AF. Although, these drugs have 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic similarities and are often grouped together, 
      it is important to recognize that the pharmacology and dose regimens differ 
      between compounds. Especially in elderly patients the new drugs have interesting 
      advantages compared to VKA, i. e., less drug-drug interactions with concomitant 
      medication and a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mostly driven by the reduction 
      of bleeding. Treatment of anticoagulation in elderly patients requires weighing 
      the serious risk of stroke with an equally high risk of major bleeding and 
      pharmacoeconomic considerations. The easier practicality of NOACs in routine 
      practice must be emphasized as no international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring 
      is necessary and the interruption of treatment for planned interventions is 
      uncomplicated. A regular monitoring of the indications for NOACs is indispensable 
      (as for all other medications). Especially elderly patients have the greatest 
      benefit from NOAC along with a low renal elimination rate and they should 
      certainly not be withheld from elderly patients who have a clear need for oral 
      anticoagulation.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetic Models for Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic 
      Review and Clinical Appraisal Using Exposure Simulation.
PG  - 353-363
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2649 [doi]
AB  - Available data have shown an association between direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      plasma concentration and clinical, particularly bleeding, events. Factors that 
      may influence DOAC plasma concentration are therefore the focus of particular 
      attention. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analyses can help in identifying 
      such factors while providing predictive models. The main aim of the present study 
      was to identify all the PopPK models to date for the four most frequently used 
      DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). The secondary aim was to 
      use these models to simulate different DOAC plasma concentration-time profiles in 
      relevant clinical scenarios. The results of our model-based simulations confirm 
      the clinical relevance of the known major factors influencing DOAC exposure and 
      support the current approved dose adaptation, at least for atrial fibrillation. 
      They also highlight how the accumulation of covariates, not currently considered 
      for dose adaptation due to their seemingly minor influence on DOAC exposure, lead 
      to supratherapeutic blood concentrations and could thus enhance the risk of major 
      bleeding. The present results therefore question DOAC dose adaptation in the 
      presence of these covariates, such as drug-drug interaction or genotypes, 
      alongside the known existing covariates. As the overall effect of accumulation of 
      several covariates could be difficult to apprehend for the clinicians, PopPK 
      modeling could represent an interesting approach for informed precision dosing 
      and to improve personalized prescription of DOACs.

AB  - Introduction: We update the knowledge, since the last review in 2017, about 
      drug-drug interactions (DDI) of non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants 
      (NOAC) in patients ≥75 years.Areas covered: The literature was searched for: 
      'dabigatran,' 'rivaroxaban,' 'edoxaban,' or 'apixaban' and drugs, affecting 
      platelet function, CYP3A4-, CYP2C9-, or P-Gp-activity. Pharmacodynamic DDI of 
      NOAC with drugs affecting platelet function like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs and antiplatelet agents occur most frequently. Pharmacokinetic DDI with 
      NOAC were found for 37 of 117 drugs. Reports about DDI with NOAC were found for 
      51% of P-gp-affecting, 38% for CYP2C9-affecting and 27% for CYP3A4-affecting 
      drugs. Reports about DDI of cardiovascular drugs with NOAC were the most 
      prevalent, followed by anti-infective and nervous system drugs. NOAC plasma 
      levels were measured in retrospective and cohort studies and were associated with 
      concomitant medication. Reports about DDI of NOAC were found in 71 patients 
      ≥75 years.Expert opinion: The knowledge about DDI of NOAC in elderly patients is 
      very limited. Studies should be carried out to investigate the role of drugs 
      potentially interacting with NOAC, which until now have not been investigated. 
      When studying DDI of NOAC, care should be taken to include elderly patients with 
      impaired renal function and patients on polymedication.

TI  - Deep vein thrombosis and novel oral anticoagulants: a clinical review.
PG  - 3123-31
LID - 6038 [pii]
AB  - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease associated with high rates of 
      mortality and significant morbidity. The diagnostic approach of DVT has evolved 
      over the years. Algorithmical use of pretest probability, D-Dimer testing and 
      ultrasonography allow safe and accurate investigation of DVT. The anticoagulation 
      therapy, used to treat DVT, includes vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and 
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UF). The duration 
      of anticoagulation therapy depends on the cause of DVT and patient's clinical 
      profile. Although these conventional therapies are effective, narrow therapeutic 
      index, need for frequent monitoring and various food-drug interactions cause 
      difficulties for patients. In recent decades, new oral anticoagulants have been 
      developed. These drugs focus directly on inhibiting either Factor Xa 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) or thrombin (dabigatran). In contrast to 
      warfarin, these new agents have shorter half-life, fewer drug or food 
      interactions, no necessity for a close monitoring and ease of administration. 
      This review summarizes current knowledge about deep vein thrombosis and new 
      treatment aspects with novel oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Direct Oral FXa Inhibitors Binding to Human Serum Albumin: Spectroscopic, 
      Calorimetric, and Computational Studies.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24054900 [doi]
LID - 4900
AB  - Direct FXa inhibitors are an important class of bioactive molecules (rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) applied for thromboprophylaxis in diverse 
      cardiovascular pathologies. The interaction of active compounds with human serum 
      albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in blood plasma, is a key research area 
      and provides crucial information about drugs' pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamic properties. This research focuses on the study of the 
      interactions between HSA and four commercially available direct oral FXa 
      inhibitors, applying methodologies including steady-state and time-resolved 
      fluorescence, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular dynamics. The 
      HSA complexation of FXa inhibitors was found to occur via static quenching, and 
      the complex formation in the ground states affects the fluorescence of HSA, with 
      a moderate binding constant of 10(4) M(-1). However, the ITC studies reported 
      significantly different binding constants (10(3) M(-1)) compared with the results 
      obtained through spectrophotometric methods. The suspected binding mode is 
      supported by molecular dynamics simulations, where the predominant interactions 
      were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (mainly π-π stacking 
      interactions between the phenyl ring of FXa inhibitors and the indole moiety of 
      Trp214). Finally, the possible implications of the obtained results regarding 
      pathologies such as hypoalbuminemia are briefly discussed.

TI  - Oral factor Xa inhibitors for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 312-20
LID - 10.1097/HCO.0b013e32833a524f [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevention of stroke and systemic emboli is paramount in the 
      management of atrial fibrillation. Although warfarin is the predominant 
      anticoagulant used in patients with atrial fibrillation, it has significant 
      limitations that have impeded appropriate use of stroke prophylaxis in eligible 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Consequently, much research has been focused 
      on finding an alternative to warfarin. We review the potential alternatives in 
      development and evaluate the current evidence concerning their safety and 
      efficacy. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors are potentially well 
      tolerated and effective replacements for warfarin. These agents do not require 
      cofactors and offer selective inhibition at a critical step of amplification in 
      the coagulation cascade. Multiple direct anti-factor Xa agents are currently 
      undergoing evaluation in phase I, II, and III trials. Early results suggest that 
      these novel anticoagulants have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profiles with minimal-to-no requirements for therapeutic monitoring. Two direct 
      factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and 
      three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation. The phase III trials of apixaban and rivaroxaban have 
      completed enrollment and are in the follow-up phase. SUMMARY: Given the growing 
      population of patients with atrial fibrillation, there is a great interest in 
      finding new therapies for oral anticoagulation. The direct factor Xa inhibitors 
      may offer several promising alternatives to warfarin therapy.

TI  - The effect of edoxaban on apoptosis in an abdominal aortic aneurysm model in 
      rats.
PG  - 378-386
LID - 10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2024.25890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of edoxaban, which is used 
      in venous thrombosis, systemic embolism, and stroke, on an aortic aneurysm model 
      and to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic and molecular effects of edoxaban through 
      the induction of apoptosis. METHODS: In this double-blind experimental study, 21 
      Wistar albino male rats (mean weight: 290 g; range, 280 to 300 g) were divided 
      into three groups: the sham group (n=7), the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 
      group (n=7), and the AAA-edoxaban group (n=7). Edoxaban 10 mg/kg was given to the 
      AAA-edoxaban group by oral gavage daily for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, the 
      aneurysmal aorta was surgically removed and histologically examined. The 
      abdominal aorta was surgically exposed and wrapped with a calcium chloride (0.5 
      mol/L) sponge for 10 min. RESULTS: Immunohistochemically, aortic sections were 
      marked with caspase-3 and caspase-9 antibodies. It was observed that the pathways 
      that trigger apoptosis (caspase-3 and caspase-9; p <0.004 and p <0.005, 
      respectively) were significantly reduced in the AAA-edoxaban group compared to 
      the AAA group. In the AAA-edoxaban group, it was observed that the expansion in 
      aortic diameter and the deterioration in the elastic fibril structure in the 
      aortic aneurysm were decreased as a result of edoxaban treatment. Edoxaban 
      treatment was observed to reduce cell death in both the tunica intima and tunica 
      media. CONCLUSION: This study provided strong evidence of the protective effect 
      of edoxaban on aortic aneurysm-related vascular damage by reducing apoptosis and 
      mitophagy.

      Anticoagulation].

LID - 10.1055/s-0042-124132 [doi]
AB  - With the recent approval of the fourth direct non vitamin K dependent oral 
      anticoagulant (NOAC) edoxaban the range of available NOACs for the treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) has expanded. Shortly thereafter, two updated 
      guidelines for the prevention and treatment of VTE have been published. In these 
      NOACs are listed as equal anticoagulants to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), 
      or fondaparinux (FDX), and VKA for the initial or maintenance treatment of VTE. 
      All NOACs are approved for the maintenance therapy after VTE and two NOACs 
      (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the initial treatment in addition in an increased 
      dose.NOACs differ in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. In 
      patients with renal insufficiency the dose of all NOACs should be reduced 
      similarly to NMH/FDX. In contrast to VKAs, bridging with NOACs in case of 
      surgical interventions is generally dispensable. Similar to NMHs or FPX renal 
      function and individual bleeding risk dependent dose intermission is generally 
      sufficient. Conventional coagulation parameters like aPTT and INR are not 
      suitable for the monitoring of NOACs. Only in seldom cases, laboratory monitoring 
      with use of adjusted anti-Xa testing or diluted thrombin time (dabigatran) may be 
      helpful.

TI  - A Descriptive Analysis of Direct Oral Anticoagulant Drugs Dosing Errors Based on

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs) interfere with the coagulation process, 
      thus improving patient care for those who require anticoagulant treatment. This 
      study presents a descriptive analysis of adverse reactions (ADRs) attributed to 
      DOAC dosage errors (overdose, underdose, and improper dose). The analysis was 
      performed based on the Individual Case Safety Reports from the EudraVigilance 
      (EV) database. Results show that data reported for rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      edoxaban, and dabigatran are mostly regarding underdosing (51.56%) compared to 
      overdosing (18.54%). The most dosage error reports were identified for 
      rivaroxaban (54.02%), followed by apixaban (33.61%). Dabigatran and edoxaban had 
      similar percentages (6.26% and 6.11%, respectively) regarding dosage error 
      reports. Since coagulation issues can become life-threatening events, and factors 
      such as advanced age and renal failure can influence the pharmacokinetics of 
      drugs, the correct usage of DOACs is of utmost importance for the management and 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism. Thus, the collaboration and the 
      complementarity of knowledge of physicians and pharmacists may offer a reliable 
      solution for DOAC dose management and improve patient care.

AB  - We aimed to review the interfering effect of DOACs on tests for haemostatic 
      function and then to discuss overcoming these with activated carbon (AC) 
      products, thereby eliminating DOAC issues from test plasmas. Recent relevant 
      articles were reviewed and are discussed. Laboratory tests for DOACs, lupus 
      anticoagulant, factor assays and APC Resistance were carried out in such 
      publications with and without an AC product on various instruments using reagents 
      approved for diagnostic use in well-regulated clinical laboratories. All reports 
      on this plasma pre-treatment by AC products agree that they extract DOACs from 
      plasma samples with minimal effect on underlying clotting tests. The specific 
      extraction of DOACs significantly reduced false positive lupus anticoagulant 
      detection and provided more reliable results in clotting factor assays, APC 
      resistance and other thrombophilia tests. Dabigatran and edoxaban seem to be 
      adsorbed more thoroughly by AC from plasmas than rivaroxaban and apixaban. In 
      summary, most of the AC products reviewed here appear to remove DOACs from test 
      plasmas without significantly affecting underlying clotting tests and permit 
      correct diagnosis of various haemostatic conditions despite the initial presence 
      of DOACs. The application of such agents as a sample pre-treatment to overcome 
      the effects of DOACs for routine coagulation testing is supported by the emerging 
      literature.

AB  - Edoxaban is an oral and direct activated factor X inhibitor. In this study, the 
      acute treatment effect of edoxaban on venous thrombosis is investigated in rats 
      by single and multiple administrations, and compared to the conventional 
      parenteral anticoagulants, enoxaparin and fondaparinux. Venous thrombus was 
      induced in the inferior vena cava by partial stenosis plus topical application of 
      10% ferric chloride for 5min. After 1-h thrombus maturation, oral edoxaban and 
      subcutaneous enoxaparin and fondaparinux were given. In the single administration 
      experiment, thrombus weight was measured 1 or 4h after thrombus induction. In the 
      multiple administration experiments, edoxaban was orally administered once daily 
      (QD) and twice daily (BID) for 3 days. In the single administration experiment, 
      oral administration of edoxaban (3.0 and 10mg/kg) 1h after thrombus formation 
      significantly regressed the venous thrombus compared to the thrombus at 1h after 
      thrombus formation. Similarly the significant venous thrombus regression was 
      observed with enoxaparin (10mg/kg) and fondaparinux (0.30-3.0mg/kg). In the 
      multiple administration experiment, both QD and BID administration of edoxaban at 
      daily doses of 5 and 10mg/kg exerted significant treatment effects. QD 
      administration of edoxaban including lower doses (1-10mg/kg) significantly 
      reduced thrombus weight. Edoxaban administered QD and BID was effective in the 
      treatment of venous thrombosis, and the treatment effect of edoxaban was 
      comparable to the conventional parenteral anticoagulants. These data demonstrate 
      the potential of edoxaban as an oral anticoagulant in the acute treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism.

TI  - Effect of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor tamoxifen on edoxaban plasma levels in 
      women with breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concomitant use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors can reduce clearance of 
      edoxaban and increase its plasma concentration. Caution is advised with 
      simultaneous use of edoxaban and the frequently used P-glycoprotein inhibitor 
      tamoxifen. However, pharmacokinetic data are lacking. OBJECTIVES: This study 
      aimed to assess the effect of tamoxifen on edoxaban clearance. METHODS: This was 
      a prospective, self-controlled, pharmacokinetic study in breast cancer 
      participants starting tamoxifen. Edoxaban was given at a dose of 60 mg once daily 
      for 4 consecutive days, first without tamoxifen and later with concomitant 
      tamoxifen in steady-state. On day 4 of both edoxaban sequences, serial blood 
      samples were taken. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using 
      nonlinear mixed effects modelling in which the effect of tamoxifen on edoxaban 
      clearance was assessed. Additionally, mean area under the curves (AUC) were 
      estimated. Geometric least square means (GLM) ratios were calculated and no 
      interaction was concluded if the 90 % CI was within the 80-125 % no-effect 
      boundaries. RESULTS: Twenty-four women with breast cancer scheduled for tamoxifen 
      were included. The median age was 56 years (IQR 51-63). The average edoxaban 
      clearance was 32.0 L/h (95 % CI, 11.1-35.0 L/h). There was no effect of tamoxifen 
      on edoxaban clearance, with a fraction of 100 % (95 % CI 92-108) compared to 
      clearance without tamoxifen. The mean AUCs were 1923 ng*h/ml (SD 695) without 
      tamoxifen and 1947 ng*h/ml (SD 595) with tamoxifen (GLM-ratio 100.4; 90 % CI 
      98.6-102.2). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor 
      tamoxifen does not lead to reduced clearance of edoxaban in patients with breast 
      cancer.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent the cornerstone therapy for 
      cardioembolic events prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
      (NVAF). In practice, the choice of one DOAC over another is guided by the 
      decision-making process of the physician, which considers specific patient and 
      drug characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and 
      long-term outcomes of a real-world population treated with DOACs, where the use 
      of the 4 different DOACs is quite equal. We conducted a retrospective 
      observational, single-center, multidisciplinary study enrolling consecutive NVAF 
      patients treated with one of the 4 DOACs. From an initial number of 753 patients, 
      we excluded 72 patients because of loss to follow-up, at the end we enrolled 
      681:174 (23%) treated with dabigatran, 175 (23%) with apixaban, 190 (25%) with 
      rivaroxaban, and 214 (29%) with edoxaban. Patients treated with apixaban were 
      significantly older, more women represented (p <0.001), and with a higher 
      cardioembolic and bleeding risk (p <0.001). Dabigatran was preferred in patients 
      with liver failure (p = 0.008), whereas Apixaban and Edoxaban were chosen in 
      chronic kidney disease (p = 0.002). At 3-year follow-up, 20 patients (2.7%) 
      experienced a systemic thromboembolic event without significant differences in 
      the 4 DOACs. In the same period, an International Society of Thrombosis and 
      Hemostasis classification major bleeding event occurred in 26 patients (3.6%), 
      more statistically correlated to edoxaban (6.1%) (p = 0.038). Thromboembolic 
      events or major bleeding were higher in the edoxaban group (10%) compared with 
      the others (p = 0.014). In our single-center real-world experience, the choice of 
      the DOAC for a patient with NVAF was tailored to specific clinical features and 
      drug pharmacokinetics of the patient. As a result, a small number of adverse 
      events were observed.

AB  - Data on drug-drug interactions (DDI) of antineoplastic drugs with anticoagulants 
      is scarce. We aim to evaluate factors associated with DDI of antineoplastic and 
      supportive care drugs with anticoagulants resulting in modification of 
      pharmacokinetics of these last mentioned. A literature review on DDI databases 
      and summaries of products characteristics (SmPC) was done. Drug-drug interactions 
      of 257 antineoplastic and supportive care drugs with direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs), warfarin, enoxaparin, or fondaparinux were categorized as no clinically 
      significant expected DDI, potentially weak DDI, potentially clinically 
      significant DDI, and recommendation against coadministration. Logistic regression 
      models were performed to analyze the association between the dependent variable 
      potentially clinically significant interaction/recommendation against 
      coadministration and the mechanisms of DDI. Of the 1799 associations, 84.4% were 
      absence of DDI, 3.6% potentially weak DDI, 10.2% potentially clinically relevant 
      DDI, and 2.0% recommendation against coadministration. Warfarin has higher DDI 
      potential than other anticoagulants. Enoxaparin and fondaparinux have fewer DDI 
      than others. There was no difference between DOACs. Drug-drug interactions with 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban was independently associated with the absence of CYP3A4 
      competition, P-glycoprotein inhibition, CYP3A4 induction, and drug class of 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Drug-drug interactions with dabigatran and edoxaban 
      was associated with inhibition of P-glycoprotein and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
      Warfarin, induction of CYP3A4, and inhibition of CYP2C9. Enoxaparin and 
      fondaparinux, only tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Direct oral anticoagulants did not 
      differ regarding DDI with antineoplastic agents. Warfarin presented more DDI than 
      other anticoagulants. P-glycoprotein inhibition and CYP3A4 induction were 
      independently associated with DDI of antineoplastic agents with DOACs.

TI  - Edoxaban transport via P-glycoprotein is a key factor for the drug's disposition.
PG  - 520-8
LID - 10.1124/dmd.113.054866 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban (the free base of DU-176b), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is 
      mainly excreted unchanged into urine and feces. Because active membrane transport 
      processes such as active renal secretion, biliary excretion, and/or intestinal 
      secretion, and the incomplete absorption of edoxaban after oral administration 
      have been observed, the involvement of drug transporters in the disposition of 
      edoxaban was investigated. Using a bidirectional transport assay in human colon 
      adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell monolayers, we observed the vectorial transport of 
      [(14)C]edoxaban, which was completely inhibited by verapamil, a strong 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. In an in vivo study, an increased distribution 
      of edoxaban to the brain was observed in Mdr1a/1b knockout mice when compared 
      with wild-type mice, indicating that edoxaban is a substrate for P-gp. However, 
      there have been no observations of significant transport of edoxaban by renal or 
      hepatic uptake transporters, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic 
      cation transporter (OCT)2, or organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1. 
      Edoxaban exhibited no remarkable inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, 
      OATP1B3, or P-gp up to 30 μM; therefore, the risk of clinical drug-drug 
      interactions due to any edoxaban-related transporter inhibition seems to be 
      negligible. Our results demonstrate that edoxaban is a substrate of P-gp but not 
      of other major uptake transporters tested. Because metabolism is a minor 
      contributor to the total clearance of edoxaban and strong P-gp inhibitors clearly 
      impact edoxaban transport, the P-gp transport system is a key factor for 
      edoxaban's disposition.

BTI - Safety, Effectiveness, and Cost-Effectiveness of New Oral Anticoagulants Compared 
      with Warfarin in Preventing Stroke and Other Cardiovascular Events in Patients 
      with Atrial Fibrillation
AB  - Approximately 250,000 Canadians are affected by atrial fibrillation (AF). Stroke 
      is a complication of AF, and Canadians with AF are five times more likely to have 
      a stroke and are twice as likely to die than individuals without AF. AF and 
      stroke are more common among the elderly. Preventing thromboembolic events such 
      as stroke is an important part of managing AF patients. Antithrombotic strategies 
      for AF patients include anticoagulant drugs, notably the coumadin class of 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, and antiplatelet agents, such as 
      aspirin. VKAs reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF by more than 60% when 
      compared with no treatment, and by 30% to 40% when compared with low-dose 
      aspirin. However, VKA use is associated with some drawbacks, including a need for 
      laboratory monitoring, an increased risk of bleeding complications, and several 
      food and drug interactions. An improved understanding of how the blood clotting 
      cascade works has led to the development of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that 
      exhibit more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, thereby obviating 
      the need for laboratory monitoring. The NOACs that have either been approved, or 
      are under review by regulators, for the prevention of thromboembolic events in AF 
      patients include dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and the direct Factor 
      Xa (FXa) inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Ximelagatran, a direct 
      thrombin inhibitor, was the first NOAC to be approved for use, but was withdrawn 
      from the market in 2006 because of safety concerns. While dabigatran, apixaban, 
      and rivaroxaban have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing 
      stroke/systemic embolism (SE) in AF patients, the relative effectiveness and 
      associated bleeding risks of these NOACs, both among themselves and in comparison 
      to warfarin, is not clear. Therefore, the aim of this project was to 
      systematically review and analyze the safety and effectiveness of three NOACs – 
      namely dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban – compared with warfarin in patients 
      with non-valvular AF. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the NOACs and 
      warfarin was assessed using economic modelling.

TI  - Anticoagulants in Children with Renal Impairment: A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.1055/a-2546-0126 [doi]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in children 
      with renal disease. To properly treat and prevent thromboembolism in this patient 
      population, it is important to be familiar with the multitude of anticoagulant 
      agents currently available. Many anticoagulant drugs undergo some extent of renal 
      elimination. There are important considerations for the selection, dosing, and 
      monitoring of anticoagulant drugs for patients with renal impairment due to 
      various pharmacokinetic alterations that may occur. While there are data to help 
      guide dosing and monitoring in adults, evidence regarding renal dose adjustment 
      of many anticoagulant drugs in children are limited. For the clinician, 
      anticoagulation management in children with renal impairment presents unique 
      challenges. In addition to considering overall bleeding risk, the extent of renal 
      impairment may vary by patient, making a one-size-fits-all approach to managing 
      these patients difficult. These factors, combined with limited data, can make 
      managing anticoagulation in children with renal impairment a challenge. 
      Therefore, the focus of this review will be to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
      the following anticoagulants in children with impaired renal function: 
      unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, 
      fondaparinux, bivalirudin, argatroban, dabigatran, and warfarin.

TI  - Andexanet alfa: a recombinant mimetic of human factor Xa for the reversal of 
      anticoagulant therapies.
PG  - 271-282
LID - 10.1358/dot.2017.53.5.2630780 [doi]
AB  - Activated coagulation factor X (FXa) is a common target for classic and newer 
      anticoagulants. Parenteral anticoagulants with an indirect inhibitory action on 
      FXa (low-molecular-weight heparins) have a well-established clinical efficacy in 
      the prophylaxis and therapy of thromboembolic conditions. More recently developed 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as a new class of antithrombotic 
      drugs. Rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are direct inhibitors of FXa approved 
      for the management of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation. Although these DOACs are associated with fewer hemorrhagic side 
      effects than classic vitamin K antagonists, bleeding is still a main 
      complication. FXa antagonists had no specific agents that could reverse their 
      antihemostatic effects. Andexanet alfa is a modified, recombinant human FXa 
      molecule with an enhanced ability to bind to both direct and indirect FXa 
      inhibitors, but unable to contribute to blood coagulation mechanisms. Andexanet 
      alfa is designed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitors. This 
      review will address the preclinical pharmacology and the main aspects of the 
      clinical development of andexanet alfa for the reversal of anticoagulant 
      therapies with an inhibitory action on FXa. It will also summarize additional 
      completed or ongoing studies on andexanet alfa available to the scientific 
      community until present.

TI  - Rapid Assay for the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Edoxaban.
LID - 10.3390/biom12040590 [doi]
LID - 590
AB  - Edoxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that has been recently indicated 
      for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Due to its 
      pharmacokinetic variability and a narrow therapeutic index, the safe 
      administration of the drug requires its therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in 
      patients receiving the treatment. In this work, we present a label-free method 
      for the TDM of edoxaban by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The new 
      method utilises the thiol chemistry of the drug to chemisorb its molecules onto a 
      highly sensitive SERS substrate. This leads to the formation of efficient 
      hotspots and a strong signal enhancement of the drug Raman bands, thus negating 
      the need for a Raman reporter for its SERS quantification. The standard samples 
      were run with a concentration range of 1.4 × 10(-4) M to 10(-12) M using a mobile 
      phase comprising of methanol/acetonitrile (85:15 v/v) at 291 nm followed by the 
      good linearity of R(2) = 0.997. The lowest limit of quantification (LOQ) by the 
      SERS method was experimentally determined to be 10(-12) M, whereas LOQ for 
      HPLC-UV was 4.5 × 10(-7) M, respectively. The new method was used directly and in 
      a simple HPLC-SERS assembly to detect the drug in aqueous solutions and in spiked 
      human blood plasma down to 1 pM. Therefore, the SERS method has strong potential 
      for the rapid screening of the drug at pathology labs and points of care.

TI  - Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants and Factors Influencing the Ischemic 
      and Bleeding Risk in Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of 
      Current Evidence.
PG  - 11-21
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000000927 [doi]
AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are a widely prescribed 
      treatment to prevent stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and 
      a therapy and preventative measure to prevent recurrences following venous 
      thromboembolism. Optimal use of NOACs requires a thorough knowledge of the 
      pharmacology of these drugs, as well as an understanding of patient factors 
      affecting their use. The 4 NOACs-dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban 
      are available in a range of doses suitable for differing indications and with a 
      variety of dose reduction criteria. Identification of the correct dose is one of 
      the key challenges in the individualization of treatment. Elderly patients with 
      atrial fibrillation are at a greater risk of both ischemic and bleeding events 
      than younger patients. Consequently, it is essential to achieve balance in 
      anticoagulation strategies. Medication adherence to NOACs is important for safe 
      and effective treatment, particularly in elderly populations. A growing body of 
      evidence shows that once-daily dosing improves adherence and persistence to 
      therapy, without having an impact on bleeding risk.

      interactions of DOACs, as well as new data from pharmacogenetic studies of these 
      drugs. This review is aimed at analyzing the scientific literature on the gene 
      polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of DOACs. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, 
      Google Scholar, and CyberLeninka (Russian version) databases with keywords: 
      'dabigatran', 'apixaban', 'rivaroxaban', 'edoxaban', 'gene polymorphism', 
      'pharmacogenetics', 'ABCB1', 'CES1', 'SULT1A', 'ABCG2', and 'CYP3A4'. The 
      articles referred for this review include (1) full-text articles; (2) study 
      design with meta-analysis, an observational study in patients taking DOAC; and 
      (3) data on the single-nucleotide polymorphisms and kinetic parameters of DOACs 
      (plasma concentration), or a particular clinical outcome, published in English 
      and Russian languages during the last 10 years. The ages of the patients ranged 
      from 18 to 75 years. Out of 114 reviewed works, 24 were found eligible. As per 
      the available pharmacogenomic data, polymorphisms affecting DOACs are different. 
      This may aid in developing individual approaches to optimize DOAC pharmacotherapy 
      to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, large-scale population 
      studies are required to determine the dosage of the new oral anticoagulants based 
      on genotyping. Information on the genetic effects is limited owing to the lack of 
      large-scale studies. Uncovering the mechanisms of the genetic basis of 
      sensitivity to DOACs helps in developing personalized therapy based on 
      patient-specific genetic variants and improves the efficacy and safety of DOACs 
      in the general population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In randomized trials, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) were 
      non-inferior to the vitamin-K-antagonist (VKA) warfarin in preventing 
      stroke/embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). DOAC are substrates 
      for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. The activity of these enzymes is 
      modulated by several drugs which might induce pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI). Drugs affecting platelet function have the potential for 
      pharmacodynamic DDI of DOAC. AREAS COVERED: The literature was searched for: 
      'dabigatran,' 'rivaroxaban,' 'edoxaban,' or 'apixaban' and drugs affecting 
      platelet function, CYP3A4-, CYP2C9- or P-gp-activity. Reports about bleeding and 
      embolic events attributed to DDI with DOAC in AF-patients were found for 43 of 
      171 drugs with interacting potential (25%), most frequently with antiplatelet and 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Whereas a co-medication of 
      platelet-affecting drugs is invariably reported to increase the bleeding risk, 
      the findings regarding P-gp-, CYP3A4- and CYP2C9- activity-affecting drugs are 
      ambiguous. EXPERT OPINION: Tests for plasma DOAC-levels and information about DDI 
      of DOAC should be widely available and user-friendly. If advantages and 
      disadvantages of DOAC and VKA can be investigated exhaustively, individualized 
      anticoagulant therapy can be offered to patients, considering co-medication, 
      comorbidities, genetic and geographic factors and the health care system.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are first-line drugs used for the treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. These drugs do not require the regular biochemical monitoring that 
      is mandatory for warfarin, and they exhibit shorter half-lives and have a faster 
      onset of action. Since recent real-world studies evidence a higher prevalence of 
      adverse side effects than what was anticipated in clinical trials, monitoring the 
      plasma concentrations of DOACs is being used to personalize their 
      pharmacotherapy, in accordance to the characteristics of the patient, and to 
      evaluate the adherence to therapy. In order to fulfill the aforementioned 
      clinical unmet needs, there are specific coagulation assays that indirectly 
      assess the plasma concentrations of DOACs. Nevertheless, these assays are not 
      sufficiently accurate or sensitive. For this reason, liquid chromatography 
      techniques coupled to mass spectrometry detection, are considered the gold 
      standard method to accurately determine plasma concentrations of DOACs. 
      Therefore, the present paper provides the first comprehensive review of the 
      current analytical methods that were developed and validated for the quantitative 
      determination of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and/or edoxaban and their main 
      metabolites in biological samples. The chromatographic methods will be 
      particularly highlighted and an emphasis will be placed on the major difficulties 
      faced during optimization and development steps. In addition, the 
      physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of each drug 
      will be critically related to chromatographic conditions. Their influence on the 
      pre-treatment procedures and storage conditions of DOACs will be examined, 
      suggesting strategies that should be applied to accurately quantify DOACs in 
      biological samples.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, two-treatment study 
      assessed the relationship between edoxaban equivalent concentration derived from 
      an anti-FXa assay with the summed concentration of edoxaban and its active 
      metabolite, M-4, as assessed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). This study also assessed the relationship between 
      edoxaban plasma concentrations assessed by LC/MS/MS in sodium citrate and lithium 
      heparin tubes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers were randomized to 
      receive once-daily edoxaban 60mg or 90mg for 5days (15 participants per treatment 
      group). Serial blood samples were collected for analysis by LC/MS/MS and by the 
      anti-FXa assay. Edoxaban equivalent levels were assessed using a commercially 
      available anti-FXa activity assay with an edoxaban-specific setup. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: The day 5 concentration estimates were significantly correlated 
      between the 2 assays (P<0.0001 for both edoxaban doses). The geometric least 
      squares mean (GLSM) ratio (90% confidence interval) for edoxaban equivalent 
      concentrations vs edoxaban + M-4 concentrations was 114.3% (108.2-120.8) for 
      edoxaban 60mg (P<0.0001) and 113.0% (107.1-119.2) for edoxaban 90mg (P=0.0002). 
      The GLSM ratio for edoxaban concentrations in sodium citrate vs lithium heparin 
      tubes for 60-mg and 90-mg edoxaban doses were 82.8% (78.5-87.3) and 83.9% 
      (79.1-89.0), respectively. In this study, an anti-FXa chromogenic assay with 
      edoxaban-specific calibrators and controls demonstrated good accuracy in 
      estimating edoxaban concentrations across a wide range of concentrations relative 
      to LC/MS/MS at steady state following the administration of once-daily edoxaban 
      for 5days.

TI  - Dosing issues with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for the treatment 
      of non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Why we should not underdose our patients.

AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban - are well established in terms of preventing stroke or 
      systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and high 
      thromboembolism risk. When prescribed incorrectly, NOACs are associated with an 
      increased risk of ischaemic events and bleeding. Current NOAC labels explicitly 
      address dose adjustments according to age, body weight, renal function and 
      concomitant treatment with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The required dose 
      adjustments vary significantly from molecule to molecule, thereby creating a 
      complex dose adjustment environment. Furthermore, recommendations support 
      assessment of individual risk using thromboembolic and bleeding risk scores. 
      Evidence-based medicine also provides data about specific patient profiles. In 
      particular, some patients who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as patients on 
      polymedication, are often at higher risk of stroke. More and more patients are 
      being treated with NOACs. The question of appropriate dosing has become 
      important, as studies are starting to show that reduced doses are being 
      prescribed at very high rates. Although these data have not been evaluated in 
      light of individual risk assessments, in everyday practice, physicians are often 
      more concerned about drug-related bleeding than about the spontaneous evolution 
      of the disease (stroke/systemic embolism), leading to high rates of prescription 
      of inadequately low doses. Recent results have shown that only certain risk 
      criteria justify dose reduction. Thus, the right dose needs to be prescribed for 
      the right patient in order to obtain, in real-life practice, the benefits of 
      NOACs that have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Comprehensive review of the impact of direct oral anticoagulants on thrombophilia 
      diagnostic tests: Practical recommendations for the laboratory.
PG  - 7-20
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13342 [doi]
AB  - There is a laboratory and clinical need to know the impact of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) on diagnostic tests to avoid misinterpretation of results. 
      Although the regulatory labelling documents provide some information about the 
      influences of each DOAC on diagnostic tests, these are usually limited to some of 
      the most common tests and no head to head comparison is available. In this paper, 
      we report the impact of DOACs on several thrombophilia tests, including 
      assessment of antithrombin, protein S and protein C activity assays, detection of 
      activated protein C resistance and assays used for lupus anticoagulant. Results 
      are compared and discussed with data obtained from literature. The final goal of 
      this comprehensive review is to provide practical recommendations for 
      laboratories to avoid misdiagnosis due to oral direct factor Xa (FXa) or IIa 
      (FIIa) inhibitors. Overall, oral direct FXa (apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban and 
      rivaroxaban) and FIIa (dabigatran) antagonists may affect clot-based 
      thrombophilia diagnostic tests resulting in false-positive or false-negative 
      results. An effect on FIIa-based thrombophilia diagnostic tests is observed with 
      dabigatran but not with anti-FXa DOACs and conversely for FXa-based thrombophilia 
      diagnostic tests. No impact was observed with antigenic/chromogenic methods for 
      the assessment of protein S and C activity. In conclusion, interpretation of 
      thrombophilia diagnostic tests results should be done with caution in patients on 
      DOACs. The use of a device/chemical compound able to remove or antagonize the 
      effect of DOACs or the development of new diagnostic tests insensitive to DOACs 
      should be considered to minimize the risk of false results.

TI  - Evaluation and validation of a clinical decision support system for dose 
      optimisation in hospitalized patients with (morbid) obesity - a retrospective, 
      observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity changes a patient's pharmacokinetics and pharmacotherapeutic 
      advices should be personalized to ensure proper treatment. Currently, 
      implementations of advices regarding the obese population are lacking and weight 
      and body mass index (BMI) are rarely monitored. The Maasstad Hospital built a 
      clinical decision support system (CDSS) for pharmacists, based on current Dutch 
      guidelines, to supply therapeutic advices for (morbidly) obese patients based on 
      patient characteristics. In this study we evaluated whether patients receiving 
      inadequate pharmacotherapy are indeed identified via this CDSS and to which 
      extent irrelevant alerts are generated. Moreover, it is investigated to which 
      extent pharmacists carry on the generated advices and to which extent physicians 
      act upon these. METHODS: The research concerned a retrospective observational 
      study performed at the Maasstad Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands between 
      January 2021 and august 2021. The drugs included were dalteparin, apixaban, 
      dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Dispensing data, 
      patient characteristics and CDSS processing were collected. Dispensing data was 
      included when the patient's weight or BMI could potentially lead to dose 
      adjustments via the CDSS. The CDSS was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). 
      Additionally, excess alerts, defined as irrelevant alerts on the moment of 
      assessment, of the CDSS and adherence to the CDSS were investigated. RESULTS: 
      1218 alerts over 3735 drug dispenses were generated. 568 alerts (46.6%) resulted 
      in a pharmacotherapeutic advice by the pharmacist to the physician. In most 
      cases, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 100.0% with varying 95% 
      CIs. For some drugs technical adjustments were needed, including the initially 
      incorrect BMI setting of vancomycin within the CDSS, resulting in a high excess 
      alerts of 56.9%. Dabigatran had a NPV of 22.2% 95% CI [6.3-54.7] and a 
      sensitivity of 56.3% 95% CI [33.2-76.9]. Overall excess alerts varied from 22.2% 
      to 56.9%. Depending on the drug, the advices resulted in 6.9-100.0% real 
      pharmacotherapy adjustments in practise. CONCLUSION: The (morbid) obesity CDSS 
      functions as expected and identifies the (morbidly) obese patients with 
      inadequate pharmacotherapy. The adherence of physicians and the follow-up in 
      practise varies widely and requires further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - The Edoxaban Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS Study: An open-label, multicenter, randomized 
      study of edoxaban for pediatric venous thromboembolic disease.
PG  - 886-892
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little evidence is available for treatment of pediatric venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). Large randomized controlled trials are challenging in 
      children. Current antithrombotic agents have many limitations, including nonoral 
      administration and frequent monitoring. Edoxaban is an oral direct inhibitor of 
      factor Xa without need of monitoring. In adults with VTE, edoxaban has shown to 
      be effective and safe. OBJECTIVES: The Edoxaban Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS Study is 
      an open-label, randomized clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of edoxaban and whether edoxaban is noninferior to standard 
      of care in treatment of pediatric VTE. METHODS: A goal of 274 patients will be 
      recruited in 5 age categories. A multidose PK/PD assessment on day 5 in the first 
      12 patients of each age group is incorporated into this study. The primary 
      composite efficacy outcome comprises symptomatic recurrent VTE, death due to VTE, 
      and no change or extension of thrombotic burden. The principal safety end point 
      is a combination of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. PK end 
      points include apparent systemic clearance and volume of distribution of 
      edoxaban. PD end points include prothrombin time, activated partial 
      thromboplastin time, and anti-factor Xa level for the edoxaban treatment arm. 
      RESULTS: To increase feasibility, the multidose PK/PD study is integrated in the 
      phase 3 trial. In addition, thrombotic burden, which is a prognostic factor for 
      post thrombotic syndrome in children, is one of the components of the primary 
      composite efficacy outcome. CONCLUSION: This study will increase the level of 
      evidence for treatment in pediatric VTE.

TI  - New oral anticoagulant agents - general features and outcomes in subsets of 
      patients.
PG  - 575-82
LID - 10.1160/TH13-09-0803 [doi]
AB  - During the past four years the phase III trials on stroke prophylaxis in atrial 
      fibrillation and on treatment of venous thromboembolism have been completed for 
      four new oral anticoagulants - dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. 
      The studies have revealed advantages in terms of a reduced risk of bleeding, most 
      importantly of intracranial bleeding. These anticoagulants also have favourable 
      pharmacokinetics, eliminating the need for routine laboratory monitoring and dose 
      adjustments. There are, however, some differences between the drugs in certain 
      subsets of patients, according to patient characteristics or to indication for 
      treatment. These features are reviewed here. The management of patients in 
      association with invasive procedures or major bleeding is also discussed. 
      Finally, a strategy of how to select patients for warfarin or the new 
      anticoagulants and thereafter possibly also among the latter is outlined.

TI  - Practical use of dabigatran etexilate for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 516-26
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12147 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, 
      and is the most prevalent factor for cardioembolic stroke. Vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) have been the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF 
      since the early 1990s. They are very effective for the prevention of 
      cardioembolic stroke, but are limited by factors such as drug-drug interactions, 
      food interactions, slow onset and offset of action, haemorrhage and need for 
      routine anticoagulation monitoring to maintain a therapeutic international 
      normalised ratio (INR). Multiple new oral anticoagulants have been developed as 
      potential replacements for VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. Most are small 
      synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa 
      (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150). These drugs have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics that allow fixed dosing without routine laboratory 
      monitoring. Dabigatran etexilate, the first of these new oral anticoagulants to 
      be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European 
      Medicines Agency for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF, 
      represents an effective and safe alternative to VKAs. Under the auspices of the 
      Regional Anticoagulation Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of experts in 
      thrombosis and haemostasis from Central and Eastern Europe, an expert panel with 
      expertise in AF convened to discuss practical, clinically important issues 
      related to the long-term use of dabigatran for stroke prevention in non-valvular 
      AF. The practical information reviewed in this article will help clinicians make 
      appropriate use of this new therapeutic option in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants, direct thrombin inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors 
      are being introduced into clinical practice. In contrast to vitamin K 
      antagonists, such as warfarin, these novel agents, because of their relatively 
      wide therapeutic range and predictable pharmacokinetics, have been evaluated in 
      clinical trials and approved for clinical use without the need for routine 
      coagulation monitoring. On occasion, it will be important to assess the 
      anticoagulant status of patients treated with these agents. As a result of their 
      targeted mechanisms of action, they affect standard coagulation assays 
      differently than vitamin K antagonists and heparins, and such assay results may 
      not provide clinically useful information. Thus, less commonly used coagulation 
      assays (eg, chromogenic anti-factor Xa activity assays, diluted thrombin time, 
      and ecarin-based clotting tests) may be introduced into clinical practice. These 
      assays are currently limited by the absence of validated therapeutic targets and 
      lack of standardization across laboratories, vendors, and medication classes. 
      This article provides an overview of the coagulation assays and their potential 
      role in determining the anticoagulant status of patients treated with the 
      emerging anticoagulants.

AB  - Thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors represent a major 
      breakthrough in the field of anticoagulation pharmacotherapy. These novel agents 
      have replaced warfarin as the oral anticoagulant of choice in certain 
      indications, as they possess equal or superior efficacy and better safety 
      profiles. They have a quick onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetic 
      properties and minimal drug and food interactions. So they do not require 
      frequent blood monitoring and dose adjustments as with warfarin. Considering all 
      the advantages, there seems to be a rapid increase in the number of patients who 
      are started on these novel anticoagulants. In this review, we highlight the 
      pharmacology of these direct oral anticoagulants and the evidence-based 
      indications for their use. We aim to provide a clinical overview for the 
      non-specialist who may be called upon to manage a patient who is currently on one 
      of these novel anticoagulants.

PG  - 1930-1945
LID - 10.1556/650.2017.30928 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have long been expected 
      drugs and they quickly became used widespread as their clinical effectiveness was 
      as good as, or even better than the previously used only oral anticoagulant drug, 
      the coumarins. Thus, the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the activated 
      factor X inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) have become the part of 
      daily therapeutic practice. Their permeation was facilitated by the guideline 
      which suggested that no laboratory monitoring was required during NOAC treatment 
      and this was very convenient for both patients and doctors. The clinical 
      experience obtained in the past years, however have proved that the 'one size 
      fits all' view is oversimplified and there are numerous situations when the 
      determination NOAC levels is unavoidable or highly recommended. This review 
      discusses the laboratory aspects of NOAC treatment, primarily summarizing their 
      effect on the screening tests and special assays of hemostasis and we also 
      describe the correct methods to determine their plasma concentrations. Orv Hetil.

TI  - Impact of Age and Factor Xa Inhibitor Concentrations on Bleeding Risk in Patients 
      with Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 156-163
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3654 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to analyze differences in the exposure-response relationship for 
      factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI) between patients aged ≥ 80 and < 80 years. Patients 
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) taking rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban were 
      enrolled, and a single steady-state trough concentration was measured. FXaI 
      concentrations were compared with the expected range reported in clinical trials 
      to define high or low drug levels. The primary outcome was major bleeding, and 
      the secondary outcome was ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (IS/TIA). 
      From 2016 to 2023, 1,037 patients aged from 30 to 105 years were enrolled 
      (average, 75.4 ± 10.0 years; 33.8% were aged ≥ 80 years). During a median 
      follow-up of 2.35 years, 48 major bleeding events and 32 IS/TIA events were 
      observed. Although drug concentrations were similar between the two age groups, 
      those aged ≥ 80 years with high FXaI levels experienced a greater increase in 
      major bleeding risk compared to those aged < 80 years with high levels (aHR 6.47 
      [2.07, 20.28] vs. 3.45 [1.15, 10.30]). Additionally, patients aged ≥ 80 years 
      without elevated FXaI levels also had a higher risk of major bleeding compared to 
      those aged < 80 years without elevated levels (aHR 2.39 [1.20, 4.76]). While low 
      FXaI concentrations were associated with IS/TIA, the risk was not significantly 
      different across age groups. In conclusion, despite similar FXaI concentrations, 
      patients aged ≥ 80 years have a higher baseline risk of major bleeding and 
      experience a greater increase in bleeding risk at high drug levels compared to 
      those aged < 80 years.

AB  - The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, as well as the direct factor Xa 
      inhibtors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, display pharmacodynamic features 
      quite similar to low-molecular-weight heparins, with a time to peak level of 1-4 
      hours after oral administration, and a half-life between 5 and 14 hours. All 
      drugs display a linear relationship and a high degree of correlation between drug 
      levels in plasma, and the anticoagulant effect. Major differences are the extent 
      of renal elimination (with 80% or more for dabigatran, 66% for rivaroxaban [33% 
      unchanged, active drug, and 33% inactive metabolites], 33% for edoxaban, and 
      finally, 25% for apixaban), and bioavailability, which determines the amount of 
      drug required for attaining the target plasma concentration of the drug. Due to 
      the reliable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, no routine laboratory 
      monitoring is necessary, although dedicated laboratory assays are available for 
      emergencies and some other specific conditions.

TI  - Usual On-therapy Ranges of Drug Concentrations in Patients with Atrial 
      Fibrillation Treated with Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 563-573
LID - 10.1055/a-2446-1348 [doi]
AB  - Although most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving a direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) do not require drug concentration measurements, there are 
      situations where such information could be useful. Existing guidance documents 
      provide usual on-therapy ranges for drug concentrations, but these have important 
      limitations.This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting 
      trough and peak levels of DOAC regimens approved for stroke prevention in AF. We 
      used random effects models and the quantile estimation method to estimate the 
      median and a usual on-therapy range (10(th) and 90(th) percentiles).Of 4,822 
      unique publications, 53 studies met eligibility (29,266 trough and 12,103 peak 
      levels). Usual on-therapy ranges for trough levels were 38 to 155 and 58 to 
      206 ng/mL for apixaban 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily; 35 to 138 and 33 to 151 ng/mL 
      for dabigatran 110 and 150 mg twice daily; 8 to 54 and 13 to 66 ng/mL for 
      edoxaban 30 and 60 mg daily; and 16 to 74 and 19 to 72 ng/mL for rivaroxaban 15 
      and 20 mg daily. The corresponding range for peak levels were 96 to 251 and 132 
      to 343; 65 to 223 and 76 to 285; 57 to 219 and 127 to 407; 131 to 384, and 169 to 
      313 ng/mL, respectively.This systematic review and meta-analysis provides updated 
      and more representative usual on-therapy ranges of DOAC levels in patients with 
      AF.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin are the most commonly prescribed 
      oral anticoagulants worldwide. However, factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of 
      VKAs, such as food and drugs, can cause deviations from their narrow therapeutic 
      window, increasing the bleeding or thrombosis risk and complicating their 
      long-term use. The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offers a safer and 
      more convenient alternative to VKAs. However, it is important to be aware that 
      plasma levels of DOACs are affected by drugs that alter the cell efflux 
      transporter P-glycoprotein and/or cytochrome P450. In addition to these 
      pharmacokinetic-based interactions, DOACs have the potential for pharmacodynamic 
      interaction with antiplatelet agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
      This is an important consideration in patient groups already at high risk of 
      bleeding, such as patients with renal impairment.

TI  - Italian intersociety consensus on DOAC use in internal medicine.
PG  - 387-406
LID - 10.1007/s11739-017-1628-6 [doi]
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are drugs used in clinical practice since 
      2009 for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation, and for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism. The four DOACs, including the three factor Xa inhibitors 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor 
      (dabigatran) provide oral anticoagulation therapy alternatives to Vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs). Despite their clear advantages, the DOACs require on the part 
      of the internist a thorough knowledge of their pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic characteristics to ensure their correct use, laboratory 
      monitoring and the appropriate management of adverse events. This document 
      represents a consensus paper on the use of DOACs by representatives of three 
      Italian scientific societies: the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI), 
      the Federation of the Associations of Hospital Managers (FADOI), and the Society 
      for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET). This document formulates 
      expert opinion guidance for pragmatic managing, monitoring and reversing the 
      anticoagulant effect of DOACs in both chronic and emergency settings. This 
      practical guidance may help the internist to create adequate protocols for 
      patients hospitalized ion internal medicine wards, where patients are often 
      elderly subjects affected by poly-morbidities and renal insufficiency, and, thus, 
      require particular attention to drug-drug interactions and peri-procedural 
      protocols.

TI  - Plasma Concentrations of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Nonvalvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation and Different Degrees of Obesity.
PG  - 453-462
LID - 10.1007/s40262-025-01474-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has multiple cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 
      including obesity. The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with 
      AF and obesity is still uncertain owing to the concern of possible ineffective 
      DOAC plasma concentration. We evaluated the peak and trough plasma concentrations 
      of DOACs in AF patients with different degrees of obesity. METHODS: Observational 
      single-center study including patients with obesity and AF, between April 2022 
      and April 2024. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30.0 kg/m(2). The 
      2-hour peak and trough DOAC plasma concentrations were assessed. Intake of DOAC 
      was verified on site. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to 
      assess the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of factors 
      associated with below-range trough concentration (BRTC) and below-range peak 
      concentration (BRPC). RESULTS: In total, 160 patients (33.8% women) with a mean 
      age of 73.2 ± 9.1 years were included. The median BMI was 32.3 kg/m(2). DOACs 
      prescribed were apixaban (46.8%), rivaroxaban (21.8%), dabigatran (16.4%), and 
      edoxaban (15.0%); 18.1% and 14.4% had BRTC and BRPC concentrations, respectively. 
      Patients with BRTC were more frequently treated with edoxaban and dabigatran and 
      had a higher BMI. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, dabigatran 
      [hazard ratio (HR) 3.039, 95% CI 1.155-7.999, p = 0.024) and BMI ≥ II class (OR 
      2.625, 95% CI 1.087-6.335, p = 0.032] were associated with BRTC. Dabigatran (OR 
      4.296, 95% CI 1.523-12.120, p = 0.006) and apixaban (OR 0.277, 95% CI 
      0.096-0.802, p = 0.018) were directly and inversely associated with BRPC, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A nonnegligible proportion of patients with obesity 
      and AF have below-range plasma concentrations of DOACs. Assessment of DOAC plasma 
      concentration in obesity class ≥ II may be useful in these patients.

      with dexamethasone.
PG  - 346-351
LID - 10.1007/s11239-021-02561-w [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not recommended in COVID-19 patients 
      receiving dexamethasone because of potential drug-drug and drug-disease 
      interactions affecting anticoagulant concentration and activity. To evaluate 
      short- and long-term pharmacokinetic interactions, serial through and peak DOAC 
      plasma levels were prospectively measured during and after dexamethasone therapy, 
      as well as during the acute phase and after recovery from COVID-19 in 
      hospitalized, non-critically ill patients undergoing treatment with DOACs. 
      Thirty-three (18 males, mean age 79 years) consecutive patients received DOACs 
      (17 apixaban, 12 rivaroxaban, 4 edoxaban) for atrial fibrillation (n = 22), 
      venous thromboembolism (n = 10), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 1). 
      Twenty-six patients also received dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for 
      a median of 14 days. Trough DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within and below 
      expected reference ranges respectively in 87.5 and 8.3% of patients, with no 
      statistically significant differences at 48-72 h and 14-21 days after 
      dexamethasone discontinuation. Peak DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within 
      expected reference ranges in 58.3% of patients, and below ranges in 33.3%, of 
      whom over two thirds had low values also off dexamethasone. No significant 
      differences in DOAC levels were found during hospitalization and after resolution 
      of COVID-19. Overall, 28 patients were discharged alive, and none experienced 
      thrombotic or bleeding events. In this study, dexamethasone administration or 
      acute COVID-19 seemed not to affect DOAC levels in hospitalized, non-critically 
      ill COVID-19 patients.

PG  - 195-207
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1546465 [doi]
AB  - The commercially available non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) 
      are an emerging therapeutic class, which includes dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban. Dose adjustment of the NOAC currently takes into account 
      the presence of particular patient characteristics that may alter NOAC 
      concentrations. These characteristics include the presence of renal impairment 
      and concomitant drugs affecting proteins involved with the transport and 
      metabolism of the NOAC. NOAC concentrations reflect anticoagulant activity; some 
      studies have shown some correlation with the risks of adverse events, while 
      others have not, and the association is debated by workers in the field. However, 
      dose adjustment based on characteristics before dosing assumes that the patient 
      has drug oral availability and clearance at the mean of patients with these 
      characteristics. Direct quantification of NOAC concentrations, for example, 
      through the use of calibrated coagulation assays, is likely to add further to 
      individualization of dosing to the particular patient.

AB  - The goal of the current study was to formulate and examine the potential of poly 
      (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as carriers to facilitate the targeted 
      administration of edoxaban tosylate monohydrate (ETM). ETM-PLGA-NPs were 
      effectively formulated using the nanoprecipitation technique. Particle size, drug 
      entrapment percentage, zeta potential, assessment of intestinal absorption, 
      FT-IR, SEM, drug dissolution behavior, and histopathology investigations were 
      used to describe ETM-PLGA-NPs. The produced NPs had a roughly spherical shape 
      with a particle size of 99.85 d.nm, a PDI of 0.478, and a zeta potential of 
      38.5 mV with a maximum drug entrapment of 82.1 %. FTIR measurements showed that 
      the drug's chemical stability remained intact after preapred into nanoparticles. 
      In vitro drug release behavior followed the Higuchi model and revealed an early 
      burst release of 30 % and persistent drug release of 78 % from optimized NPs for 
      up to 120 hrs. According to in vitro data, a 1:10 ratio of ETM to PLGA provided 
      longer-lasting ETM release and improved encapsulation efficiency. Images captured 
      with an inverted fluorescent microscope exhibited that NPs may both greatly 
      increase the amount of ETM accumulated in the intestinal tract and make it easier 
      for ETM to enter the membrane beneath the cells of the intestines. The study 
      found that using PLGA nanoparticles to encapsulate the ETM resulted in longer 
      circulation duration (aPTT, PT, TT). In vivo investigations found that 
      nanoparticles encapsulated had no negative impact on hematological parameters, 
      lung, liver, or kidney tissues. All things considered, the NPs are a potential 
      delivery method to increase the oral absorption and antithrombotic activity of 
      ETM.

TI  - Implications of Recent Drug Approvals for Older Adults.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - More than 100 medications were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as 
      new drugs or for new indications in 2014 and 2015. Several of the new drugs may 
      benefit older adults, but adverse events and pharmacokinetic changes due to aging 
      must be considered. This article will focus on three recently approved drugs that 
      are marketed for chronic conditions that can affect older adults: suvorexant, for 
      treatment of insomnia; edoxaban, for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 
      in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism; and droxidopa, for treatment of symptomatic neurogenic 
      orthostatic hypotension. Information about indications, mechanisms of action, 
      dosing, efficacy, and safety are reviewed. The place of each agent in therapy for 
      older adults is also discussed.

TI  - Laboratory testing in the era of direct or non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants: a practical guide to measuring their activity and avoiding 
      diagnostic errors.
PG  - 208-27
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1546827 [doi]
AB  - A new generation of antithrombotic agents has recently emerged. These provide 
      direct inhibition of either thrombin (factor IIa [FIIa]) or FXa, and are 
      increasingly replacing the classical anticoagulants (heparin and coumarins such 
      as warfarin) in clinical practice for a variety of conditions. These agents have 
      been designated several acronyms, including NOACs, DOACs, and TSOACs, 
      respectively, referring to new (novel; non-vitamin K antagonist) oral 
      anticoagulants, direct oral anticoagulants, and target-specific oral 
      anticoagulants, and currently include dabigatran (FIIa inhibitor), and 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban (FXa inhibitors). The pervading 
      mantra that NOACs do not require laboratory monitoring is countered by ongoing 
      recognition that laboratory testing for drug effects is needed in many 
      situations. Moreover, since these agents "do not require" laboratory monitoring, 
      some clinicians inappropriately take this to mean that they do not affect 
      hemostasis tests. This review aims to briefly review the laboratory studies that 
      have evaluated the NOACs against a wide range of laboratory assays to assess 
      utility for qualitative or quantitative measurements of these drugs, as well as 
      interferences that may cause misdiagnosis of hemostatic defects. Point of care 
      testing, including use of alternate samples such as urine and serum, is also 
      under development but is not covered extensively in this review. The main aims of 
      this article are to provide practical guidance to general laboratory testing for 
      NOACs, as well as to help avoid diagnostic errors associated with hemostasis 
      testing performed on samples from treated patients, as these currently comprise 
      major challenges to hemostasis laboratories in the era of the NOACs.

TI  - Edoxaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation at the Extremes of 
      Body Weight: An Analysis from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Trial.
PG  - 140-149
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1716540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  The effects of anticoagulants at extremes of body weight (BW) are 
      not well described. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes in patients randomized to 
      warfarin, higher dose edoxaban (HDER), and lower dose edoxaban (LDER) regimens at 
      extremes of BW in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. METHODS AND RESULTS:  We analyzed three BW 
      groups: low BW (LBW: <5th percentile, ≤55 kg, N = 1,082), middle BW (MBW: 
      45th-55th percentile, 79.8-84 kg, N = 2,153), and high BW (HBW: >95th percentile, 
      ≥120 kg, N = 1,093). In the warfarin arm, LBW patients had higher rates of 
      stroke/systemic embolism (SSE: 6.5 vs. 4.7 in MBW vs. 1.6% in HBW, P 
      (trend) < 0.001), major bleeding (MB: 9.3 vs. 7.7 vs. 6.5%, P (trend) = 0.08), 
      and worse net clinical outcome of systemic embolic event, MB, or death (31.5 vs. 
      19.1 vs. 16.0%, P (trend) < 0.0001). The time-in-therapeutic range with warfarin 
      was lowest in LBW patients (63.0 vs. 69.3 vs. 70.1% patients, P (trend) < 0.001). 
      The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of edoxaban was consistent across BW 
      groups. The risk of SSE was similar between HDER and warfarin for each of the 
      three weight groups (P (int) = 0.52, P (int-trend) = 0.86). MB was reduced by 
      LDER versus warfarin (P (int) = 0.061, P (int-trend) = 0.023), especially in LBW 
      patients. Net clinical outcomes were improved by HDER versus warfarin (P 
      (int) = 0.087, P (int-trend) = 0.027), especially in LBW patients. CONCLUSION: 
       Patients with LBW in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 had in general a more fragile clinical 
      status and poorer international normalized ratio control. The 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of edoxaban was consistent across 
      extremes of BW, resulting in similar efficacy compared with warfarin, while major 
      or clinically relevant non-MB and net outcomes were most favorable with edoxaban 
      as compared to warfarin in LBW patients.

TI  - Binding of direct oral anticoagulants to the FA1 site of human serum albumin.
PG  - e2877
LID - 10.1002/jmr.2877 [doi]
AB  - The anticoagulant therapy is widely used to prevent and treat thromboembolic 
      events. Until the last decade, vitamin K antagonists were the only available oral 
      anticoagulants; recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed. 
      Since 55% to 95% of DOACs are bound to plasma proteins, the in silico docking and 
      ligand-binding properties of drugs apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
      and rivaroxaban and of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate to human serum albumin 
      (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, have been investigated. DOACs bind to 
      the fatty acid (FA) site 1 (FA1) of ligand-free HSA, whereas they bind to the FA8 
      and FA9 sites of heme-Fe(III)- and myristic acid-bound HSA. DOACs binding to the 
      FA1 site of ligand-free HSA has been validated by competitive inhibition of 
      heme-Fe(III) recognition. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for 
      DOACs binding to the FA1 site (ie, (calc) K(DOAC) ) derived from in silico 
      docking simulations (ranging between 1.2 × 10(-8) M and 1.4 × 10(-6) M) agree 
      with those determined experimentally from competitive inhibition of heme-Fe(III) 
      binding (ie, (exp) K(DOAC) ; ranging between 2.5 × 10(-7) M and 2.2 × 10(-6) M). 
      In addition, this study highlights the inequivalence of rivaroxaban binding to 
      mammalian serum albumin. Given the HSA concentration in vivo (~7.5 × 10(-4) M), 
      values of K(DOAC) here determined indicate that the formation of the HSA:DOACs 
      complexes in the absence and presence of FAs and heme-Fe(III) may occur in vivo. 
      Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for DOACs transport.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticoagulant actions of oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors 
      can be inferred from their observed plasma concentrations; however, the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of different FXa inhibitors have not been 
      compared in clinically. METHODS: The sensitivity of the rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban in the STA-Liquid Anti-FXa assay were compared, and the anti-FXa 
      plasma concentrations were measured for PK assessments. Nonlinear mixed-effects 
      modeling was used to assess population PK in 329 patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Patients were followed up for an average 
      of 3.6 years. RESULTS: Sensitivity was similar among the three drugs in this 
      assay, which could directly compare plasma concentrations instead of anti-FXa 
      activities. Overall exposure was greatest in 5 mg BID apixaban relative to other 
      drugs (p < 0.001). The geometric mean AUC for the 0 to 24-h interval was 
      4550 ng h/mL for apixaban, 2710 ng h/mL for 15 mg QD rivaroxaban, and 
      1290 ng h/mL for 60 mg QD edoxaban. The PKs of 2.5 mg BID apixaban or 15 mg QD 
      rivaroxaban were associated with hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was 
      associated with greater exposure, higher trough concentrations in plasma compared 
      with rivaroxaban or edoxaban. Furthermore, a higher plasma concentration may 
      partially predict hemorrhagic events.

AB  - The new anticoagulants (NOACs) tested for prevention or treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute 
      coronary syndromes (ACS) differ in bioavailability, metabolism, route of 
      excretion and interaction with other drugs, but have remarkably similar 
      pharmacokinetics, with very similar half lives. However the choice of dosing 
      regimens in different clinical conditions has been different for the various 
      NOACs, and has been established on the basis of widely different considerations, 
      including the clinical setting (venous versus arterial thrombosis), the 
      indications (prophylaxis versus treatment), the likelihood of concomitant 
      antiplatelet drugs, and marketing opportunities; these latter were based on the 
      knowledge that patients' compliance is generally better with once daily than with 
      twice daily dosing. Current prevailing wisdom is that peak plasma drug 
      concentrations are important determinants of bleeding: since a fractioning of the 
      total daily dose into a twice daily regimen reduces peak plasma drug 
      concentrations compared with once daily dosing, this should maximize safety. 
      However, recent pharmacokinetic analyses of a phase II study with edoxaban in AF 
      found that bleeding, with the same daily dosing, was less frequent with once 
      daily dosing than with twice daily dosing, and correlated - better than other 
      pharmacokinetic parameters - through drug concentrations. Higher rates of 
      bleeding have been also reported with the twice daily versus once daily dosing of 
      darexaban in a phase II study in ACS. These results may lead to a rethinking on 
      the pathophysiology of bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation.

TI  - Testing the therapeutic equivalence of novel oral anticoagulants for 
      thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery and for prevention of stroke in atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 211-9
LID - 10.5414/CP202183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In studying the comparative effectiveness of novel oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) in orthopedic surgery and in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation, previous meta-analyses have found no proof of difference in 
      head-to-head indirect comparisons between individual agents. However, the 
      question of their therapeutic equivalence remains unanswered. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objective of this analysis was to test the equivalence of three NOACs 
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) in orthopedic surgery and four NOACs 
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation. METHODS: Standard pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis 
      for indirect comparisons were combined with equivalence testing. The endpoint was 
      venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery and a composite of stroke or 
      systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. Comparisons were expressed as risk 
      difference (RD). Margins for equivalence testing were derived from the original 
      trials. RESULTS: Our results indicate that rivaroxaban and apixaban (but not 
      dabigatran) are equivalent for thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery. In 
      atrial fibrillation, all the four NOACs we tested were found to meet the 
      criterion of therapeutic equivalence. Some concern, however, is raised by some 
      findings focused on adverse events of these agents, in which the equivalence was 
      not proven in all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of clinical implications, our 
      results can be the basis to develop local acquisition tenderings on NOACS. In 
      Italy, a new law has been issued according to which equivalence analyses have 
      become a mandatory prerequisite for local tenderings.

PG  - 622-630
LID - 10.33963/KP.a2021.0021 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, are widely used for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 
      in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation as well as for prevention and 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism. Although DOACs do not require routine 
      laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant effect, there are special situations in 
      which laboratory assessment may be warranted. Laboratory tests include 
      quantitative assays, which measure plasma DOAC levels, and qualitative or 
      semi-quantitative assays, which may be used to screen for the presence of 
      clinically relevant DOAC levels. Indications for laboratory assessment include 
      emergent indications (serious bleeding, urgent surgery, acute ischemic stroke 
      with consideration of thrombolysis) and elective indications (extremes of 
      bodyweight, renal hypo- or hyperfunction, liver disease, suspected drug-drug 
      interactions, suspected gastrointestinal malabsorption). In general, quantitative 
      assays that measure DOAC levels may be used for elective indications, whereas 
      screening assays may be necessary for emergent indications if a quantitative 
      assay with sufficiently rapid turnaround time is not available. Therapeutic 
      ranges for DOACs have not been defined. In lieu of therapeutic ranges, data from 
      pharmacokinetic studies may be used to determine whether a patient's plasma DOAC 
      level falls within the expected range. If it does not, a change in therapy may be 
      warranted. Depending on the clinical scenario, a change in therapy may involve 
      adjustment of the DOAC dose, a change to a different DOAC, or a change to a 
      different class of anticoagulant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly population is known to be associated with polymedication, 
      comorbidities and altered drug pharmacokinetics. However, the most adequate oral 
      anticoagulant, attending to its relative efficacy and safety, remains unclear. 
      METHODS: We searched for phase III randomized controlled trials (MEDLINE, 
      Cochrane Library, SciELO collection and Web of Science) comparing novel 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with Vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKA) in the elderly population (≥75 years-old) in atrial fibrillation (AF). Risk 
      ratios (RR) were calculated using a random effects model. Trial sequential 
      analysis (TSA) was performed in statistically significant results to evaluate 
      whether cumulative sample size was powered. RESULTS: Four trials rendered data 
      about elderly (≥75 years-old) and younger patients (<75 years-old) with AF. NOACs 
      demonstrated a 30% significant risk reduction (RR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.80) in 
      elderly patients compared to VKA, without heterogeneity across studies 
      (I(2) = 0%). The TSA showed that cumulative evidence of this subgroup exceeded 
      the minimum information size required for the risk reduction. In younger 
      patients, VKA and NOACs shared a similar risk of stroke and systemic embolism (RR 
      0.97, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.18). Regarding major bleeding risk in the elderly, the 
      overall comparative risk of NOACs was not different from VKA (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 
      0.72 to 1.16; I(2) = 86%). CONCLUSIONS: NOACs reduce significantly the risk of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in elderly patients without increasing major 
      bleeding events. The dimension of stroke risk reduction was significantly higher 
      in the elderly than in younger adults.

TI  - Microdosed Cocktail of Three Oral Factor Xa Inhibitors to Evaluate Drug-Drug 
      Interactions with Potential Perpetrator Drugs.
PG  - 1155-1163
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00749-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to prove the suitability of simultaneously 
      administered microdoses of the factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban (100 µg in total). To evaluate drug-drug interactions, the impact of 
      ketoconazole, a known strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, 
      was studied. METHODS: In a crossover clinical trial, 18 healthy volunteers were 
      randomized to the two treatments using microdoses of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban alone and when coadministered with ketoconazole. Plasma and urine 
      concentrations of microdosed apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were quantified 
      using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification of 2.5 pg/ml. RESULTS: 
      The microdosed FXaI cocktail showed similar pharmacokinetic parameters compared 
      with published data, using normal therapeutic doses of each FXaI. Ketoconazole 
      significantly increased exposure, with geometric mean AUC ratios of 1.90 
      (apixaban), 2.35 (edoxaban) and 2.27 (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSION: The microdosed 
      FXaI cocktail approach was able to precisely predict the drug interaction with 
      ketoconazole. This is the first study that has been conducted to evaluate 
      drug-drug interactions with a drug class, and the low administered doses also 
      allow evaluation in vulnerable target populations. STUDY PROTOCOL: EudraCT 
      2016-003024-23.

AB  - Nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) are currently 
      recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke. As a group, 
      NOACs significantly reduce stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality, with 
      lower to similar major bleeding rates compared with warfarin. All NOACs are 
      dependent on the kidney for elimination, such that patients with creatinine 
      clearance <25 ml/min were excluded from all the pivotal phase 3 NOAC trials. It 
      therefore remains unclear how or if NOACs should be prescribed to patients with 
      advanced chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis. The authors review the 
      current pharmacokinetic, observational, and prospective data on NOACs in patients 
      with advanced chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) and those 
      on dialysis. The authors frame the evidence in terms of risk versus benefit to 
      bring greater clarity to NOAC-related major bleeding and efficacy at preventing 
      stroke specifically in patients with creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A number of new oral anticoagulant drugs that selectively and 
      directly inhibit factor Xa (FXa) appear as promising alternatives to the existing 
      anticoagulant agents. These compounds present a convenient route of 
      administration with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that allow 
      fixed dosing regimens without requiring coagulation monitoring. Rivaroxaban is 
      the first of this new class of drugs that was approved for the prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) after elective total hip replacement or total knee 
      replacement surgery in the EU, Canada and several other countries. Clinical 
      trials with rivaroxaban in patients with acute VTE and in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation have been recently completed. Numerous other compounds are under 
      different developing stages (apixaban, edoxaban, otamixaban, LY517717, 
      PRT-054021, YM150). AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the two 
      oral anti-FXa drugs at the most advanced stage of development (rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban) and briefly describes and comments on the results of the most important 
      studies. EXPERT OPINION: Undoubtedly, these new drugs will offer several 
      advantages over the previous compounds, but a number of issues still require some 
      attention during the phase of translation from clinical trials into daily 
      clinical practice.

AB  - The geometries and energies of factor Xa inhibitors edoxaban, eribaxaban, 
      fidexaban, darexaban, letaxaban, and the dual factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors 
      tanogitran and SAR107375 in both the gas-phase and aqueous solution were studied 
      using the Becke3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) or Grimme's B97D/6-31++G(d,p) method. The fully 
      optimized conformers of these anticoagulants show a characteristic l-shape 
      structure, and the water had a remarkable effect on the equilibrium geometry. 
      According to the calculated pKa values eribaxaban and letaxaban are in neutral 
      undissociated form at pH 7.4, while fidexaban and tanogitran exist as 
      zwitterionic structures. The lipophilicity of the inhibitors studied lies within 
      a large range of log P between 1 and 4. The dual inhibitor SAR107375 represents 
      an improvement in structural, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics 
      over tanogitran. At blood pH, SAR107375 predominantly exists in neutral form. In 
      contrast with tanogitran, it is better absorbed and more lipophilic and active 
      after oral application.

TI  - Perioperative management of patients on new oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 742-9
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9485 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer an alternative to warfarin for 
      preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. NOACs are expected to 
      replace warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists for most of their indications in 
      the future. Knowledge of the use of NOACs in the perioperative period is 
      important for optimal care. METHODS: Studies that reported on the use of NOACs 
      were identified, focusing on evidence-based guidance relating to the 
      perioperative period. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published between 
      January 2000 and January 2014. RESULTS: The anticipated expanded clinical use of 
      NOACs such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto™), apixaban (Eliquis™) and dabigatran 
      (Pradaxa™) has the potential to simplify perioperative anticoagulant management 
      because of fewer drug-drug interactions, rapid onset of action, predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and relatively short half-lives. However, coagulation status 
      cannot be monitored by international normalized ratio and no antidotes are 
      currently available. In elective surgery, it is important to discontinue the use 
      of NOACs, with special consideration of renal function as route of elimination. 
      Guidelines for the management of bleeding complications in patients on NOACs are 
      provided, and may be considered for trauma and emergency surgery. Haemodialysis 
      could be considered for bleeding with use of dabigatran. Better options for 
      reversal of the effects of NOACs when bleeding occurs may follow with novel 
      drugs. CONCLUSION: Management of NOACs in elective and emergency conditions 
      requires knowledge of time of last intake of drug, current renal function and the 
      planned procedure in order to assess the overall risk of bleeding. Currently no 
      antidote exists to reverse the effects of these drugs.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: 
      Magnitude of the problem and new approach to oral anticoagulation.
PG  - 578-588
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12250 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD) with a prevalence of up to 27%. The 
      incidence rate of stroke in AF patients on HD is approximately 5%. The 
      AF-associated risk of stroke is a major clinical challenge because current 
      evidence for anticoagulation in HD patients with AF is based on observational 
      data. Results from these observational studies is largely contradictory because 
      they do not show a clear benefit of vitamin K antagonists over no treatment in 
      terms of stroke prevention, and they show an increased risk of hemorrhage 
      associated with anticoagulation treatment in HD patients. HD patients were not 
      included in randomized trials of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and 
      therefore there is no evidence to support efficacy and safety of DOACs compared 
      to vitamin K antagonists in HD patients. The pharmacological characteristics of 
      DOACs are of particular interest in the HD setting. The factor Xa inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are not predominantly eliminated via the 
      kidneys. The thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is 80% eliminated via the kidneys but 
      is dialyzable due to its low protein binding. In this narrative review, we 
      examine the current state of evidence regarding the prevalence of AF in patients 
      on HD, the associated risk of stroke, and the efficacy and safety of 
      anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the HD setting. Further, based on the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of DOACs, we discuss their potential use in patients 
      on HD and ongoing randomized trials.

AB  - In the last few years, several phase III clinical trials of new drug treatments 
      for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have been carried out or are about to finish. 
      These drugs have a predictable and reliable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      response and do not require monitoring and are consequently an attractive 
      alternative for the treatment of a high proportion of patients with DVT. 
      Dabigatran, edoxaban and idrabiotaparinux have been developed as an alternative 
      to warfarin, and apixaban and rivaroxaban as one-drug only treatment for this 
      disease, with a 1- or 3-week intensified phase of initial treatment, 
      respectively. So far, the reported results show non-inferior efficacy and safety 
      to warfarin or to conventional treatment. Therefore, the new anticoagulants will 
      be particularly useful in patients with unstable INRs, warfarin incompatible 
      pharmacologic interactions, and in those without access to regular coagulation 
      monitoring.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are mostly prescribed to prevent cardioembolic 
      stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). An increasing 
      number of guidelines recommend DOAC in AF patients with preserved renal function 
      for the prevention of thromboembolism, and an increased use of DOAC in daily 
      practice has been recorded also in elderly patients. Ageing is associated with a 
      reduction in glomerular filtration rate, and impaired renal function, regardless 
      of the cause, increases the risk of bleeding. Multiple medication use 
      (polypharmacy) for treating superimposed co-morbidities is common in both elderly 
      and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and drug-drug interaction may cause 
      accumulation of DOAC, thereby increasing the risk of bleeding. The safety profile 
      of DOAC in patients with CKD has not been defined with any certainty, 
      particularly in those with severely impaired renal function or end stage renal 
      disease. This has been due to the heterogeneity of studies and the relative 
      paucity of data. This document reports the position of three Italian scientific 
      societies engaged in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation who are 
      treated with DOAC and present with CKD.

AB  - Although the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require 
      routine monitoring, there are special circumstances in which laboratory 
      measurement may be warranted. The objectives of this review are to summarize 
      evidence on the influence of the NOACs on coagulation tests and provide practical 
      guidance to clinicians on measurement and interpretation of coagulation assays in 
      NOAC-treated patients. Selection of an appropriate assay for NOAC measurement 
      depends on the drug, clinical objective, and assay availability. Separate 
      suggestions for assay selection are provided depending on whether specialized 
      assays are available or whether choice is limited to conventional coagulation 
      assays such as the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin 
      time (APTT). The dilute thrombin time (TT) and ecarin-based assays are able to 
      quantify dabigatran across a broad range of concentrations, but are not widely 
      available. A normal TT excludes clinically relevant levels. A normal APTT 
      probably excludes excess levels of dabigatran, but does not rule out typical 
      on-therapy drug concentrations. The PT is insufficiently sensitive to dabigatran 
      to be useful in most situations. Factor Xa inhibitors may be quantified with an 
      anti-Xa assay calibrated with drug-specific standards. A normal PT probably 
      excludes excess levels of rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but not typical on-therapy 
      levels of these agents. The PT is less sensitive to apixaban. Depending on the 
      sensitivity of the thromboplastin reagent, a normal PT may not exclude excess 
      levels of apixaban. The APTT has inadequate sensitivity to factor Xa inhibitors 
      and is not recommended for their measurement.

AB  - The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Chronic 
      Kidney Disease Abstract. Increasing life expectancy in Western countries is 
      associated with a high prevalence of multiple chronic diseases which is defined 
      by the term "multimorbidity". Many of these patients suffer from chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and thrombogenic comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation with the 
      need for oral anticoagulation. For decades vitamin K antagonists have been 
      exclusively prescribed for oral anticoagulation. However, due to altered 
      pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of these drugs in CKD, a significant risk of 
      bleeding exists. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants as a new and 
      promising alternative to vitamin K antagonists was -especially for CKD patients - 
      highly anticipated. However, data from randomized studies are missing for older 
      patients with advanced CKD. Consequently, a careful evaluation of the 
      risk-benefit ratio is recommended for this sensitive patient population.

TI  - How to handle a delayed or missed dose of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation? A model-informed remedial strategy.
PG  - 2066-2075
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15316 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Edoxaban is a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) widely 
      used for the long-term prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF). Adherence to NOAC therapy has been unsatisfactory and 
      decreases over time. Remedial strategies are currently used to address the 
      non-adherence events. Current recommendations, however, are generic and not well 
      supported by evidence. The aim of this study was to explore appropriate remedial 
      dosing regimens for non-adherent edoxaban-treated NVAF patients through Monte 
      Carlo simulation. METHODS: Six regimens were compared with the current 
      recommendations of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) guide based on 
      total deviation time. Both edoxaban plasma concentration and intrinsic Factor Xa 
      activity were considered. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using RxODE 
      based on a published population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model. 
      RESULTS: The proposed remedial strategies were different than the EHRA 
      recommendations and were related to the delay time. However, it was found that 
      the missed dose can be administered immediately if the delay time is within 11 h. 
      When the delay is between 12 and 19 h, a half dose followed by a regular dosing 
      schedule is recommended. When the delay time exceeds 19 h, a full dose followed 
      by a half dose is preferred. CONCLUSION: PK/PD modelling and simulation are 
      effective in developing and evaluating the remedial strategies of edoxaban, which 
      can help maximise its therapeutic effect.

AB  - Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a potentially fatal and avoidable medical 
      condition that poses a burden on global health care costs. The rate of major GIB 
      related to the use of some direct acting oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs), is 
      higher than that detected in warfarin users. Current strategies in the treatment 
      of GIBs in patients receiving warfarin or DOACs (vitamin K, activated charcoal; 
      hemodialysis; recombinant factor VIIa; [activated] prothrombin complex 
      concentrates) including indications for the treatment of bleeding based on 
      different degrees of severity of the episodes, is reported in this article. 
      Potential preventive strategies to mitigate the risk of GIBs (e.g. upper 
      endoscopy/biopsy, colon cancer screening; eradication of Helicobacter pylori 
      prior to starting anticoagulation; use of proton-pump inhibitors, identification 
      of risk factors for bleeding) are also reported as well as the fact that some of 
      them have not been tested so far in patients receiving DOACs. Antidotes that 
      experimentally reverse the anti-coagulant effect of dabigatran (Idarucizumab; BI 
      655075; Boehringer Ingelheim); of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban (Andexanet 
      alfa, r-Antidote, PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) or of all DOACs (Aripazine, 
      PER-977, ciraparantag; Perosphere Inc.) are discussed. Likewise, population 
      pharmacokinetics modeling related to the rate of major DOACs-related GIBs is 
      presented. It is also emphasized that the occurrence of GIB reflects the presence 
      of patients at the highest risk for adverse outcomes. Finally, the implications 
      of the concept that patient characteristics and the severity of illness (i.e. 
      comorbidities) exert a greater impact on the risk of GIB than the type of 
      antithrombotic agent employed, are analyzed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa 
      Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) 
      trial, the lower dose edoxaban regimen (LDER) and the higher dose edoxaban 
      regimen (HDER) were noninferior to well-managed warfarin for stroke prevention in 
      atrial fibrillation. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present analysis of the 
      ENGAGE AF TIMI-48 trial was to comprehensively compare the net clinical outcome 
      (NCO) of LDER (30 mg once daily, dose reduced to 15 mg in selective patients) 
      versus HDER (60 mg once daily, dose reduced to 30 mg in selective patients). 
      METHODS: This study performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 
      trial, comparing patients on LDER versus HDER. RESULTS: The pre-defined primary 
      NCO (stroke/systemic embolism [SEE], major bleeding, death) was less frequent 
      with LDER (7.26% vs. 8.01%; hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 
      0.98; p = 0.014). The secondary (disabling stroke, life-threatening bleeding, or 
      all-cause mortality) and tertiary pre-defined NCOs (stroke, SEE, life-threatening 
      bleeding, or all-cause mortality) were similar between the 2 dosing regimens. 
      Patients randomized to LDER versus HDER had a significantly higher risk of 
      stroke/SEE (2.04% vs. 1.56%; hazard ratio: 1.31; 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 
      1.52; p < 0.001). Conversely, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, major 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, and life-threatening bleeding occurred significantly 
      less frequently with LDER compared with those of HDER. These findings were 
      supported by multiple pharmacokinetic findings. CONCLUSIONS: In the ENGAGE 
      AF-TIMI 48 trial, the primary NCO was reduced with LDER versus HDER, whereas the 
      secondary and tertiary NCOs were similar between the 2 dosing regimens. These 
      results may aid physicians in evidence-based individualization of edoxaban 
      dosing. However, the approved HDER remains the standard therapy among the 
      available edoxaban dosing regimens for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Effective reversal of edoxaban-associated bleeding with four-factor prothrombin 
      complex concentrate in a rabbit model of acute hemorrhage.
PG  - 387-98
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000000520 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is an oral, selective direct factor Xa inhibitor approved in 
      Japan for venous thromboembolism prevention after orthopedic surgery. Data are 
      lacking regarding reversal strategies for edoxaban; this study assessed whether 
      four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (Beriplex/Kcentra; CSL Behring GmbH, 
      Marburg, Germany) can effectively reverse its effects on hemostasis using a 
      previously described rabbit model. METHODS: The study comprised assessments of 
      thrombin generation in vitro, pharmacokinetic parameters, and edoxaban reversal 
      in vivo. In a blinded in vivo stage, a standardized kidney incision was performed 
      in animals (n = 11 per group) randomized to receive vehicle + saline, edoxaban 
      (1,200 μg/kg) + saline, or edoxaban (1,200 μg/kg) + four-factor prothrombin 
      complex concentrate (50 IU/kg). Animals were monitored for treatment impact on 
      hemostasis and coagulation parameters. Data are median (range). Statistical tests 
      were adjusted for multiple testing. RESULTS: Edoxaban administration increased 
      blood loss (30 [2 to 44] ml) and time to hemostasis (23 [8.5 to 30.0] min) 
      compared with the control group (3 [1 to 8] ml and 3 [2.0 to 5.0] min, 
      respectively). Biomarkers of coagulation (prothrombin time, activated partial 
      thromboplastin time, whole blood clotting time) and thrombin generation 
      parameters (e.g., peak thrombin, endogenous thrombin potential, lag time) were 
      also affected by edoxaban. Administration of four-factor prothrombin complex 
      concentrate significantly reduced time to hemostasis (to 8 [6.5 to 14.0] min, 
      observed P < 0.0001) and total blood loss (to 9 [4 to 22] ml, observed P = 
      0.0050) compared with the edoxaban + saline group. Of the biomarkers tested, 
      prothrombin time, whole blood clotting time, and endogenous thrombin potential 
      correlated best with clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: In a rabbit model of 
      hemostasis, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate administration 
      significantly decreased edoxaban-associated hemorrhage.

TI  - Randomized, multicenter, warfarin-controlled phase II study of edoxaban in 
      Japanese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1840-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban is a once-daily (QD) oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor in 
      clinical development for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of 
      edoxaban in Japanese patients with NVAF. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 536 NVAF 
      patients (CHADS2 ≥1) were randomized to receive double-blinded edoxaban 30, 45, 
      or 60 mg QD or open-label warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] 2.0-3.0 
      for age <70 years; 1.6-2.6 for age ≥70 years) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint 
      was the incidence of all bleeding events (major, clinically relevant non-major, 
      and minor bleeds). Patients underwent CT and/or MRI to assess asymptomatic 
      intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Secondary endpoints included thromboembolic events 
      and pharmacodynamic indices. The mean incidence of all bleeding events for 
      edoxaban 30, 45, and 60mg, and warfarin was 18.5%, 22.4%, 27.7%, and 20.0%, 
      respectively. There were no statistically significant differences among the 
      edoxaban groups and no significant differences from the warfarin group. There 
      were no asymptomatic ICH events in any group. One episode of cerebral infarction 
      was observed in the edoxaban 45-mg group. Subgroup analysis suggested low body 
      weight (≤60kg) was associated with higher bleeding risk. CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban 
      30, 45, and 60mg QD in patients with NVAF was associated with a numerical 
      increase in all bleeding across the dose range, but this was not statistically 
      significant, nor was any dose compared with warfarin.

TI  - Impact of Renal Function on Outcomes With Edoxaban in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 
      Trial.
PG  - 24-36
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.022361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor with 50% renal clearance, was 
      noninferior to well-managed warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism (S/SE) 
      prevention and reduced bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. We 
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin across the range of 
      baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective 
      Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial 
      Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study 48) with a focus on the 
      higher-dose edoxaban regimen (HDER) and the upper range of CrCl. METHODS: A total 
      of 14 071 patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk for stroke 
      were randomized to warfarin or HDER (60 mg daily or a 50% dose reduction to 30 mg 
      daily for CrCl 30-50 mL/min, body weight of ≤60 kg, or use of a potent 
      phosphorylated glycoprotein inhibitor). CrCl <30 mL/min was exclusionary. End 
      points of S/SE, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major 
      bleeding, and the net clinical outcome of S/SE/major bleeding or death were 
      evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis using the prespecified CrCl cut point of 
      50 mL/min and additional exploratory cut points with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. 
      A sensitivity analysis was performed with the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Epidemiology Collaboration) formula for estimating renal function. RESULTS: The 
      relative risk of S/SE with HDER versus warfarin in patients with CrCl >50 mL/min 
      (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.04) was similar to 
      that in patients with CrCl ≤50 mL/min (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.18; P for 
      interaction=0.94). Several exploratory analyses suggested lower relative efficacy 
      for the prevention of S/SE with HDER compared with warfarin at higher levels of 
      CrCl (CrCl ≤50 mL/min: HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.18; CrCl >50-95 mL/min: HR, 0.78; 
      95% CI, 0.64-0.96; CrCl >95 mL/min: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.88-2.10; P for 
      interaction=0.08). Bleeding rates were lower at all levels of CrCl with HDER (P 
      for interaction=0.11). Because of the preserved effect on bleeding, the net 
      clinical outcome was more favorable with HDER across the range of CrCl (P for 
      interaction=0.73). Similar findings were observed in the sensitivity analysis 
      using the CKD-EPI formula. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was an apparent decrease 
      in relative efficacy to prevent arterial thromboembolism in the upper range of 
      CrCl, the safety and net clinical benefit of HDER compared with warfarin are 
      consistent across the range of renal function. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are among the most effective options to 
      prevent serious thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
      Coagulation assays are used to assess DOAC activity, but lack the possibility to 
      quantify drugs with concurrent pharmacodynamic effect. We developed a selective 
      multi-drug assay to analyze apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, edoxaban 
      M4, and rivaroxaban with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) in plasma fulfilling all requirements of 
      the FDA und EMA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. Plasma samples 
      were extracted using solid phase extraction in a 96-well micro volume format. 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters BEH Phenyl 1.7μm column 
      coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Extraction recoveries exceeded 80 %. 
      Concentrations of 1-1000 ng/ml can be precisely quantified (correlation 
      coefficient of >0.99) using 100 μL plasma volume. Intra-day and inter-day 
      accuracies ranged between 91.0 % and 116 %. Precisions at low and high 
      concentrations were below 13.3 %. The method was applied within a clinical drug 
      trial and eight short pharmacokinetic profiles of patients under DOAC therapy 
      were analyzed. The assay allows for highly sensitive and selective simultaneous 
      quantification of DOACs in patient plasma samples.

AB  - To simplify and optimize oral anticoagulation, new target-specific oral 
      anticoagulants (TSOAs) have been developed. The direct thrombin-inhibitor 
      dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban 
      are the first such compounds to receive approval in certain countries for various 
      indications. Due to the predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles 
      of these drugs, routine monitoring of patients receiving TSOA therapy has not 
      been considered necessary. However, it has now been realized that in routine 
      clinical settings, there are several situations where it may be prudent to assess 
      the level of TSOA anticoagulation. Several studies evaluating the influence of 
      TSOAs on various coagulation assays have been performed to identify systems that 
      can be used to monitor these drugs. With a particular focus on dabigatran and 
      rivaroxaban, we will describe and discuss the potential of several methods for 
      measuring the anticoagulant effect of TSOAs, as well as their methodological 
      limitations and the restrictions in transferring their results into clinical 
      context.

TI  - Implications of Augmented Renal Clearance on Drug Dosing in Critically Ill 
      Patients: A Focus on Antibiotics.
PG  - 1063-75
LID - 10.1002/phar.1653 [doi]
AB  - Augmented renal clearance (ARC) has been reported in approximately 30-65% of 
      patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite the presence of a normal serum 
      creatinine concentration. In certain ICU patient populations (e.g., patients with 
      sepsis or trauma), the incidence increases to roughly 50-85%. Risk factors for 
      ARC include the following: age younger than 50-55 years, male sex, higher 
      diastolic blood pressure, fewer comorbidities, and a lower Acute Physiology and 
      Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) or modified Sequential Organ Failure 
      Assessment (SOFA) score at ICU admission. In addition, patient populations with 
      the highest reported incidence of ARC include those with major trauma, sepsis, 
      traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and central nervous system 
      infection. Due to the high incidence of ARC in patients with a normal serum 
      creatinine concentration, clinicians should consider screening ICU patients 
      deemed high risk by using the ARC scoring system or the identification and 
      assessment algorithm provided in this review. In addition, an 8-hour continuous 
      urine collection should be considered to assess a measured creatinine clearance 
      for evaluating the necessity of medication dosage adjustments. There is a clear 
      association between ARC and subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations as well as 
      literature suggesting worse clinical outcomes; thus, the risk of underdosing 
      antibiotics in a patient with ARC could increase the risk of treatment failure. 
      This review examines strategies to overcome ARC and summarizes current 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic literature in patients with ARC in an effort 
      to provide dosing guidance for this patient population.

TI  - ENNOBLE-ATE trial: an open-label, randomised, multi-centre, observational study 
      of edoxaban for children with cardiac diseases at risk of thromboembolism.
PG  - 1213-1219
LID - 10.1017/S1047951121002523 [doi]
AB  - Children with cardiac diseases suffer from significant morbidity and mortality 
      secondary to thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulant agents currently used 
      for thromboprophylaxis have many limitations, including subcutaneous 
      administration (low molecular weight heparins) and requirement for frequent 
      monitoring via venipuncture (vitamin K antagonists). Edoxaban is an oral direct 
      factor Xa inhibitor without need of monitoring. In the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism in adults, edoxaban has shown to be effective and safe.This 
      manuscript summarises the rationale and design of a phase 3, open-label, 
      randomised controlled trial to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of 
      edoxaban against standard of care (namely, vitamin K antagonist and low molecular 
      weight heparin) in children with cardiac diseases.A goal of 150 children with 
      cardiac diseases at risk of thromboembolic complications who need primary or 
      secondary anticoagulant prophylaxis will be recruited. Eligible children between 
      6 months and <18 years of age will be randomised in a ratio of 2 to 1 for 
      edoxaban versus standard of care. Randomisation will be stratified based on 
      underlying cardiac disease and concomitant use of aspirin for patients other than 
      Kawasaki disease. The primary outcome will be safety, comprised of major and 
      clinically relevant non-major bleeding in first 3 months of treatment. Bleeding 
      beyond 3 months, symptomatic and asymptomatic thromboembolic events, and 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters will be evaluated as secondary 
      outcomes.Randomised controlled anticoagulation trials are challenging in 
      children. This study will evaluate a potentially valuable alternative of oral 
      anticoagulant prophylactic use in children with cardiac diseases.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most common arrhythmia in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). As in the general population, in CKD patients AF is 
      associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism and stroke. However, CKD 
      patients, especially those on renal replacement therapy (RRT), also exhibit an 
      increased risk of bleeding, especially from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral 
      anticoagulation is the most effective form of thromboprophylaxis in patients with 
      AF presenting increased risk of stroke. Limited evidence on efficacy, the 
      increased risk of bleeding as well as some concern regarding the use of warfarin 
      in CKD, has often resulted in the underuse of anticoagulation CKD patients. A 
      large body of evidence suggests that non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant 
      agents (NOACs) significantly reduce the risk of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, 
      and mortality, with lower to similar major bleeding rates compared with vitamin K 
      antagonist such as warfarin in normal renal function subjects. Hence, they are 
      currently recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke. 
      However, NOACs metabolism is largely dependent on the kidneys for elimination and 
      little is known in patients with creatinine clearance <25ml/min who were excluded 
      from all pivotal phase 3 NOACs trials. This review focuses on the current 
      pharmacokinetic, observational, and prospective data on NOACs in patients with 
      moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance 15-49ml/min) 
      and those on dialysis.

TI  - Evaluation of regional gastrointestinal absorption of edoxaban using the enterion 
      capsule.
PG  - 1286-92
LID - 10.1002/jcph.540 [doi]
AB  - Two studies in healthy subjects assessed the absorption of edoxaban when 
      delivered to specific locations within the gastrointestinal tract using Enterion 
      capsules. In study 1 (single-dose, 4-way crossover), 8 participants received 
      edoxaban 60 mg as immediate-release (IR) tablets (treatment A), as powder 
      formulation delivered to the distal small bowel (treatment B) or ascending colon 
      (treatment C), or as an aqueous suspension delivered to the ascending colon 
      (treatment D). In study 2 (single-dose, 2-way crossover), 10 participants 
      received edoxaban 30 mg as IR tablets (treatment E) or in granulate formulation 
      with fumaric acid 50 mg, added to acidify the local gastrointestinal tract and 
      enhance solubility, delivered to the ascending colon (treatment F). Peak and 
      total exposure following targeted drug delivery to the distal gastrointestinal 
      tract were significantly lower than with IR tablet delivery. In study 1, total 
      exposure ratios of treatments B, C, and D compared with A were 14.9%, 7.9%, and 
      6.1%, respectively. In study 2, relative total exposure was 12.6% for treatment F 
      despite the fumaric acid. Time to peak concentration was longer with higher 
      variability for edoxaban delivered to the distal gastrointestinal tract compared 
      with the IR tablet. These data indicate that edoxaban absorption occurs 
      predominantly in the proximal small intestine.

AB  - The present research looked for ways to develop shielded nanoparticles (NPs)-drug 
      transporters made of chitosan (CS) to enhance the bioavailability of edoxaban 
      tosylate monohydrate (ETM) for oral administration by examining the correlation 
      among design aspects and data from experiments using response surface methodology 
      (RSM). ETM-loaded CS nanoparticles (ETM-CS-NPs) were developed using the ionic 
      gelation of CS with tripolyphosphate (TPP). Utilising Zeta-sizer and scanning 
      electron microscopy, the ETM-CS-NPs were evaluated for particle size (PS), zeta 
      potential (ZP), surface morphology, polydispersity index (PDI), entrapment 
      efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL). Drug and polymer interactions in NPs were 
      assessed using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. The response surface 
      approach and Design-Expert software optimised the ETM-CS-NPs. Using RSM, the 
      effects of independent variables such as the amount of CS, the amount of TPP, and 
      the amount of glacial acetic acid on PS, PDI and ZP were analysed. The optimal 
      combination of PS (354.8 nm), PDI (0.509), ZP (43.7 + mV), % EE (70.3 ± 1.3) and 
      % DL (9.1 ± 0.4) has been identified for the optimised ETM-CS-NPs. ETM-CS-NPs' 
      anticoagulant activity was evaluated using activated partial thromboplastin time 
      (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) assays. In conclusion, a 
      practical and consistent method has been established, and its application has 
      been proven in vitro, indicating its utility for future studies of the biological 
      distribution of ETM-CS-NPs in vivo for specific antithrombotic treatments.

TI  - Plasma levels do not predict thrombin generation in patients taking direct oral 
      anticoagulants.
PG  - 1539-1548
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antithrombotic effect of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in 
      specific clinical scenarios is difficult to assess. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed 
      to evaluate the effect of DOAC on thrombin generation (TG) in relation to their 
      plasma level. METHODS: Eighty patients newly started on anticoagulation were 
      included, 20 patients for each DOAC-apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and 
      dabigatran. Plasma was sampled before DOAC (baseline), at plasma peak time, 6 and 
      12 hours after starting DOAC for quantification of drug levels and TG. RESULTS: 
      The baseline TG before DOAC intake showed inter-individual variability. All DOACs 
      significantly prolonged lag time (LT) and time to peak (TTP), but did not change 
      endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Anti-Xa inhibitors but not dabigatran 
      reduced thrombin peak, but the effect of apixaban at plasma peak was less 
      pronounced (factor 1.6). LT and TTP prolongation of dabigatran was lower compared 
      to anti-Xa inhibitors. All DOACs showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship, 
      with the greatest antithrombotic effect at lower DOAC plasma levels. The 
      inhibition of TG parameters between baseline and peak was parallel between 
      individual patients but the coefficient of variation of TG was lower compared to 
      drug levels. CONCLUSION: The antithrombotic effect at DOAC peak plasma level 
      measured by TG depends on the patient-specific baseline TG level and the 
      drug-specific inhibition by the particular DOAC. Although peak plasma levels have 
      a high variability, the variation of TG is lower compared to drug levels. 
      Therefore, TG assays may be superior to plasma levels in the assessment of the 
      intensity of anticoagulation.

      factor (Xa). DOACs have a different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics 
      profiles, with less probable drug-drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists. 
      They do not require systematic therapeutic monitoring except in specific clinical 
      situations such as emergency procedures or drug non-compliance. Furthermore, 
      anticoagulant effects of DOACs could be impacted by renal impairment, drug-drug 
      interactions, food interactions, or pharmacogenetic variability. In this context, 
      we developed a method for simultaneous determination of dabigatran, rivaroxaban 
      and apixaban in human plasma using high performance liquid chromatography coupled 
      with a mass spectrometry assay and applied it to 26 patient samples. Our method 
      presents a total run time of 5 min and extends from 25 to 1000 μg/L for apixaban 
      and dabigatran; and from 5 to 1000 μg/L for rivaroxaban. Intra- and inter-assay 
      accuracy were between -22.3 and 25.4%; and - 23.7 and 3.8%, respectively. 
      Precision at low and high concentrations were below 17.5%. Frozen samples were 
      stable up to 3 months. No significant cross-contamination was observed. In 
      conclusion, our assay can be used during clinical studies and in daily routine 
      practice for the management of specific clinical situations at reasonable cost.

AB  - Aspirin and P2Y12 receptor antagonists are widely used across the spectrum of 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Gastrointestinal complications, 
      including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment 
      and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often 
      prescribed. However, potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been 
      suggested for PPIs, and, in recent years, it has been discussed whether these 
      drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, 
      clopidogrel. Indeed, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an 
      interaction through CYP2C19 between PPIs and clopidogrel, which could translate 
      into clinical inefficacy, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular events. The 
      Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency sent a warning in 
      2010 discouraging the concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or 
      esomeprazole. In addition, whether the use of PPIs may affect the clinical 
      efficacy of the new P2Y12 receptor antagonists, ticagrelor and prasugrel, remains 
      less known. According to current guidelines, PPIs in combination with 
      antiplatelet treatment are recommended in patients with risk factors for 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent use of 
      anticoagulants, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
      Helicobacter pylori infection. Like traditional anticoagulants, novel oral 
      anticoagulants may cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Results from both randomized 
      clinical trials and observational studies suggest that high-dose dabigatran (150 
      mg bid), rivaroxaban and high-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily) are associated with a 
      higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding as compared with warfarin. However, the 
      usefulness of PPIs in patients receiving these anticoagulants deserves to be 
      further demonstrated. Given the large number of patients treated with 
      antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet inhibition or 
      anticoagulant effect potentially carries a considerable clinical impact. The 
      present joint statement by ANMCO and AIGO summarizes the current knowledge 
      regarding the widespread use of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, and PPIs in 
      combination. Moreover, it outlines evidence supporting or opposing drug 
      interactions between these drugs and discusses consequent clinical implications.

TI  - Impact of four direct oral anticoagulants on rotational thromboelastometry 
      (ROTEM).
PG  - 84-93
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12744 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a point of care method 
      used to monitor coagulation during surgery and to guide transfusion strategies in 
      patients presenting with severe bleeding. The aim of our study was to determine 
      the impact of four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) on 3 commonly used ROTEM 
      tests. METHODS: Whole blood samples from 20 healthy donors were spiked in vitro 
      with apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban or dabigatran at 5 different plasma 
      concentrations (0-1000 ng/mL). EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests were systematically 
      performed. RESULTS: There was a linear relationship between the increase in 
      clotting time (CT) and plasma DOAC concentrations in both the EXTEM and INTEM 
      tests. We found that the DOAC concentration required to double EXTEM CT was 
      1042 ± 225 ng/mL for apixaban, 134 ± 38 ng/mL for edoxaban, 176 ± 26 ng/mL for 
      rivaroxaban and 284 ± 73 ng/mL for dabigatran. INTEM CT was less sensitive than 
      EXTEM CT whatever the anticoagulant. EXTEM CT was above the normal range for 5 of 
      5 spiked samples when the plasma concentrations were ~1000 ng/mL for apixaban, 
      ~100 ng/mL for edoxaban, ~200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban and ~200 ng/mL for 
      dabigatran. Maximum Clot Firmness in EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests was not 
      affected whatever the DOAC or its concentration. CONCLUSION: This study found a 
      DOAC dose-dependent increase in ROTEM CTs. ROTEM tests were only poorly impacted 
      by low levels of edoxaban, rivaroxaban or dabigatran. Apixaban had only a low 
      effect even at high concentrations.

TI  - Reduced Anticoagulant Effect of Dabigatran in a Patient Receiving Concomitant 
      Phenytoin.
PG  - e5-7
LID - 10.1002/phar.1698 [doi]
AB  - Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant indicated for 
      the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the 
      treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 
      Dabigatran, as well as the other new anticoagulants-rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
      edoxaban-are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Although the U.S. labeling for 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban states to avoid concomitant use with phenytoin, a known 
      P-gp inducer, the U.S. labeling for dabigatran and edoxaban are less clear. We 
      describe the first case report, to our knowledge, documenting a drug interaction 
      between phenytoin and dabigatran by using laboratory measurements of dabigatran 
      serum concentrations. A 45-year-old African-American man was admitted to the 
      inpatient cardiology service following defibrillations from his implantable 
      cardioverter defibrillator. The patient was evaluated and received appropriate 
      antitachycardia pacing for atrial tachyarrhythmias for an episode of ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT), and antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol was initiated to reduce 
      both his AF and VT burden. On review of the patient's medications for potential 
      interactions, it was discovered that the patient was taking both dabigatran and 
      phenytoin. To determine the magnitude of this drug interaction prior to making a 
      change in his anticoagulation regimen, a dabigatran serum concentration was 
      measured. This concentration was undetectable, indicating that phenytoin had a 
      significant influence on dabigatran's metabolism and that this patient was at 
      high risk for stroke. Clinicians should be aware of this interaction between 
      phenytoin and dabigatran as well as with all other new oral anticoagulants. In 
      patients taking phenytoin who require an anticoagulant, only warfarin should be 
      prescribed to minimize the risk of stroke. In addition, the prescribing 
      information for dabigatran should be updated to include other medications that 
      result in a significant reduction in dabigatran serum concentrations, such as 
      phenytoin.

TI  - In Vitro Comparison of the Role of P-Glycoprotein and Breast Cancer Resistance 
      Protein on Direct Oral Anticoagulants Disposition.
PG  - 183-191
LID - 10.1007/s13318-017-0434-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetics of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are influenced 
      by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
      Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). OBJECTIVES: To better understand the 
      role of transporters in DOAC disposition, we evaluated and compared the 
      permeabilities and transport properties of these drugs. METHODS: Bidirectional 
      permeabilities of DOACs were investigated across Caco-2 cells monolayer. 
      Transport assays were performed using different concentrations of DOAC and 
      specific inhibitors of ABC transporters. Cell model functionality was evaluated 
      by transport assay of two positive control substrates. RESULTS: The results of 
      transport assays suggest a concentration-dependent efflux of apixaban, dabigatran 
      etexilate and edoxaban, whereas the efflux transport of rivaroxaban did not seem 
      to depend on concentration. Verapamil, a strong inhibitor of P-gp, decreased DOAC 
      efflux in the Caco-2 cell model by 12-87%, depending on the drug tested. Ko143 
      reduced BCRP-mediated DOAC efflux in Caco-2 cells by 46-76%. CONCLUSION: This 
      study allowed identification of three different profiles of ABC carrier-mediated 
      transport: predominantly P-gp-dependent transport (dabigatran), preferential 
      BCRP-dependent transport (apixaban) and approximately equivalent P-gp and 
      BCRP-mediated transport (edoxaban and rivaroxaban).

TI  - An in vitro study to investigate the interference of enoxaparin on plasma levels 
      of direct oral factor Xa inhibitors measured by chromogenic assays.
PG  - 309-315
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12974 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Co-administration of enoxaparin and a direct oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor (xabans: apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) could give rise to the 
      problem of overlapping the anti-Xa activity when measuring direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) levels. We aimed to evaluate in vitro the degree of the 
      interference of increasing enoxaparin concentrations on xaban plasma levels 
      measured by different chromogenic anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators 
      and controls. METHODS: Seven plasma samples were spiked with apixaban, edoxaban, 
      or rivaroxaban at fixed concentration, and enoxaparin at increasing 
      concentrations (0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.50, 1.0, 1.50, and 2.0 IU/mL). The evaluated 
      chromogenic assays were as follows: Biophen DiXaI and Biophen Heparin LRT (Hyphen 
      BioMed), Berichrom Heparin and Innovance Heparin (Siemens), STA-Liquid Anti-Xa 
      (Stago Diagnostics), Technochrom anti-Xa (Technoclone), and HemosIL Liquid 
      Anti-Xa (Werfen). RESULTS: The presence of enoxaparin caused increased DOAC 
      levels, with over-estimation depending on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample. The smallest over-estimation was in the sample with 
      enoxaparin 0.125 IU/mL and the greatest in the sample with enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL 
      (0%, 3.1%, and 7.4% vs 583.8%, 526.1%, and 415.2% for apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, respectively). Biophen DiXaI showed lower interference compared to 
      other methods (maximum over-estimation in the presence of enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL: 
      56.4% dosing rivaroxaban by Biophen DIXaI vs 583.8% dosing apixaban by Berichrom 
      Heparin). CONCLUSION: The presence of enoxaparin interferes with xabans 
      measurement by chromogenic anti-Xa assays causing falsely elevated DOAC levels, 
      the over-estimation being dependent on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample.

AB  - The noninferiority of direct oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors (rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban) in treatment of atrial fibrillation were demonstrated 
      compared with warfarin by several large clinical trials; however, subsequent 
      meta-analyses reported a higher risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban than with 
      the other FXa inhibitors. In the present study, we first estimated the changes of 
      prothrombin time (PT) in 5 randomized trials based on reported population 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models and then carried out a model-based 
      meta-analysis to obtain models describing the relationship between PT changes and 
      the event rates of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and of major bleeding. 
      By using the models, we simulated the optimal therapeutic doses for each FXa 
      inhibitor. It was suggested that dose reduction of rivaroxaban from the current 
      20 mg/d to 10 mg/d would decrease patient deaths from major bleeding (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.74) with little increase 
      in those for ischemic stroke/SE (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.20). The overall 
      decrease in the mortality caused by both events was estimated as 5.81 per 10 000 
      patient-years (95% CI, 3.92-8.16), with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91). For 
      apixaban and edoxaban, no distinct change in the overall mortality was simulated 
      by dose modification. This study suggested that the current dose of rivaroxaban 
      might be excessive and would need to be reduced to decrease the excess risk of 
      major bleeding.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants: development of a 
      consensus list for ambulatory care.
PG  - 364-374
LID - 10.1007/s11096-022-01511-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can be involved in clinical 
      relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) which may compromise safe and effective 
      use. However, assessing the clinical relevance of DDIs with DOACs and managing 
      these interactions optimally, can be challenging in clinical practice. AIM: To 
      develop a practice-oriented list of potentially clinically relevant DDIs with 
      DOACs with corresponding management plans for which it is important to screen in 
      ambulatory care. METHOD: The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to develop 
      the DOACs DDI list. In a first step a preliminary list was compiled of 
      potentially clinically relevant DDIs per DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
      rivaroxaban) using five reference sources. Subsequently, a two-step modified 
      Delphi process involving a multidisciplinary panel (n = 10) including both 
      pharmacists and physicians with expertise in all decision-making disciplines 
      involved in care for patients using DOACs and with diversity of practice setting, 
      was used to reach expert agreement on a final list of DDIs with corresponding 
      management plans. RESULTS: After a two-step consensus round, 71 DDIs for 20 
      different interacting drugs were included: five pharmacodynamic, nine 
      pharmacokinetic inhibitor and six pharmacokinetic inducer interacting drugs. 
      Considerations raised and discussed by the panellists were related to (1) the 
      necessity of the interacting drug, (2) the manageability of the DDI (whether 
      there are any alternatives), (3) the (clinical) evidence-base for the DDI and (4) 
      the (potential) consequences of the DDI. CONCLUSION: We developed a consensus 
      list with specific and straightforward management plans on potentially clinically 
      relevant DDIs with DOACs, for use in ambulatory care.

AB  - The use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has become a 
      breakthrough in anticoagulant treatment and it is expected to rise significantly 
      in upcoming years. The use of conventional anticoagulants have several 
      limitations: subcutaneous administration of heparin, or close monitoring of INR 
      during application of vitamin K antagonists. In the last decade, target-specific 
      oral anticoagulants (TSOAC) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban 
      have been marketed for prophylaxis and treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to 
      understand the potential uses, side effects, and management of these agents in 
      routine practice. NOACs have major pharmacologic advantages, including a rapid 
      onset and offset of action, fewer drug interactions than conventional 
      anticoagulants, and predictable pharmacokinetics. These agents are gaining 
      popularity among both physicians and patients because of their easiness of 
      administration and the eliminating the requirement for regular coagulation 
      monitoring. In this review, we focus on discussing practical recommendations for 
      the use of NOACs and the risks and benefits of incorporating them into routine 
      practice.

      treated with edoxaban by APTT waveform.
PG  - 49-55
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12727 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An analysis of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in 
      major orthopedic surgery patients receiving edoxaban for the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) was carried out. METHODS: The APTT waveform was analyzed in 
      the above patients to monitor edoxaban administration. RESULTS: Of these 99 
      patients, 12 exhibited deep vein thrombosis, and 25 had massive bleeding. An 
      increased biphasic pattern of the APTT waveform was observed after the 
      administration of edoxaban, but there were no significant differences between the 
      patients with and without complications. The peak times of acceleration, 
      velocity, and 1/2 fibrin formation were significantly prolonged after the 
      administration of edoxaban, especially in patients with massive bleeding, and 
      were moderately correlated with the anti-Xa activity. While the heights of 
      velocity and acceleration peak 2 were lower in patients receiving warfarin 
      treatment than in those receiving edoxaban, the widths of these parameters were 
      significantly longer. The height of 1/2 fibrin formation and the width of 
      acceleration peaks 1 and 2 and the velocity were significantly increased after 
      the administration of edoxaban. CONCLUSION: The peak time of the APTT waveform 
      was significantly prolonged after the administration of edoxaban. The analysis of 
      the APTT waveform may therefore be useful for the prediction of the risk of 
      massive bleeding.

AB  - There is limited information regarding the performance of tests for direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs). To generate more knowledge, the accuracy of DOAC tests 
      were evaluated using external quality assessment data from multiple years. This 
      data demonstrated a good correlation for the tests with a small overall 
      interlaboratory variability (10% for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban and 12% 
      for edoxaban). The greatest differences between the various reagents were 
      observed for rivaroxaban, especially for concentrations below 100 ng/ml. In 
      conclusion, the results show overall reliable DOAC levels with some differences 
      between reagent groups. Important finding: clinical decision criteria could be 
      affected by the choice of reagent.

TI  - Characterisation of exposure versus response of edoxaban in patients undergoing 
      total hip replacement surgery.
PG  - 887-95
LID - 10.1160/TH12-03-0184 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Japan. The objectives of this analysis were to 
      characterise the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban and the 
      relationships between edoxaban exposure and clinical outcomes in a phase IIb 
      study of surgical patients following total hip replacement (THR). A total of 
      1,795 subjects from a phase IIb study, 10 phase I studies, and three phase IIa 
      studies were included in the PK analysis. The exposure-response analysis included 
      data from surgical patients assigned to edoxaban in the phase IIb study. Edoxaban 
      disposition in healthy and post-surgical patients was well-described with a 
      linear, two-compartment model. Creatinine clearance was significantly correlated 
      with edoxaban clearance and the rate of oral absorption was affected by surgery. 
      The probability of a post-operative VTE was significantly correlated with 
      steady-state metrics of edoxaban exposure estimated for each subject by Bayesian 
      post-hoc methods with age and gender being the significant and expected 
      covariates. The incidence of bleeding was low in these studies and hence no 
      exposure-response relationship could be identified. These analyses suggest that 
      edoxaban has a predictable anticoagulant effect in this patient population 
      leading to dose-proportional reduction in incidence of VTE with low incidence of 
      bleeding.

AB  - The understanding of the clotting system emerged in parallel to the development 
      of anticoagulants. In contrast to vitamin K-antagonists and heparins that where 
      discovered by chance, new anticoagulants have been systematically designed to 
      specifically inhibit single clotting factors. Both clotting factors Xa (FXa) and 
      thrombin play a crucial role within the new cell-based model of hemostasis. Thus 
      it is obvious that FXa and thrombin turned out to be ideal targets for 
      anticoagulation. The proof of the concept of selective inhibition of thrombin and 
      FXa has been provided by hirudin and fondaparinux, respectively. By now, a whole 
      group of new oral anticoagulants has been licensed: the direct FXa-inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban as well as the direct thrombin dabigatran 
      etexilate. Furthermore, a bundle of FXa- and thrombin-inhibitors that differ from 
      the so far licensed products mainly in pharmacokinetics are in an advanced phase 
      of development. A further innovative concept of anticoagulation that entered its 
      clinical phase of development is the inhibition of factor VIII. Other new 
      concepts such as inhibition of initiation of coagulation by blocking factor VIIa, 
      inhibition of contact factor XII, or inhibition of factor IX are in an early 
      phase of development.

AB  - In this review we present comparison of pharmacokinetics of novel oral 
      anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, principles 
      of selection of a regimen of their dosing for phase III clinical trials in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Multiplicity of administration of NOAC depends 
      on required level of anticoagulation, ability to maintain anticoagulation for 24 
      hours, relationship between minimal and maximal levels of equilibrium 
      concentrations, efficacy and safety. Once a day administration of some drugs of 
      this group is reasonable from positions of clinical pharmacology. It can provide 
      not only better adherence to treatment but greater safety relative to development 
      of bleeding.

AB  - Measuring direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) concentrations might be necessary in 
      certain clinical situations but is not routinely performed. The DOAC Dipstick is 
      a new rapid test for detecting DOACs in urine. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the possible uses and limitations of the DOAC Dipstick and to compare 
      visual analysis and DOASENSE Reader analysis of DOAC Dipstick pads. Plasma and 
      urine samples were collected from 23 patients taking DOACs. DOAC concentrations 
      in plasma and urine were measured by chromogenic substrate assays and in urine 
      also by the DOAC Dipstick. Plasma concentrations were dichotomized at a threshold 
      of ≥30 ng/mL. Patient samples were compared with samples from control individuals 
      not using anticoagulants (n = 10) and with DOASENSE control urines. The Combur-10 
      test was used to measure parameters that may affect urine color and hence the 
      interpretation of the DOAC Dipstick result. DOAC Dipstick test results were 
      positive in 21/23 patient urine samples at a plasma DOAC concentration of 
      ≥30 ng/mL and in 2/23 patient urine samples at a plasma DOAC concentration of 
      <30 ng/mL. Inter-observer agreement was above 90% for visual analysis of patient 
      urine samples and was 100% for DOASENSE Reader analysis of patient urines and for 
      analysis of control group urines and DOASENSE control urines. Abnormalities in 
      urine color detected by the Combur-10 test did not affect the DOAC Dipstick 
      results. DOAC Dipstick detects DOACs in urine at a plasma threshold of ≥30 ng/mL. 
      Positive DOAC Dipstick results should be confirmed by measuring DOAC plasma 
      concentration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a once-daily, non-vitamin 
      K antagonist oral anticoagulant. There is no established method to reverse the 
      activity of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in cases of hemorrhage or urgent 
      surgery. This study evaluated the ability of a 3-factor prothrombin complex 
      concentrate (3F-PCC) to reverse the anticoagulatory effects of edoxaban. METHODS: 
      In this phase 1 study, 24 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 
      single dose of 60 or 180mg edoxaban, followed by placebo, 25IU/kg 3F-PCC, or 
      50IU/kg 3F-PCC. Edoxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including the 
      primary endpoint of prothrombin time (PT) and endogenous thrombin potential 
      (ETP), were assessed. D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 (F1+2) were also 
      measured. RESULTS: Overall, there were no apparent consistent effects of 3F-PCC 
      on edoxaban pharmacokinetics. Administration of 3F-PCC 25 or 50IU/kg with 
      edoxaban 60 or 180mg did not substantially accelerate the return of PT to 
      baseline levels. However, infusion of 3F-PCC 25 and 50IU/kg did substantially 
      accelerate return to baseline of ETP compared with placebo. D-dimer and F1+2 data 
      did not indicate any lasting procoagulant effects of 3F-PCC infusion, although a 
      transient increase in F1+2 was noted during and after 3F-PCC infusion. Edoxaban 
      and 3F-PCC co-administration was well tolerated in normal healthy subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no apparent reversal of PT prolongation with 3F-PCC 
      following edoxaban infusion, but ETP was completely reversed. Co-administration

AB  - Many patients under oral anticoagulation therapy need percutaneous or surgical 
      interventions/operations. For vitamin K antagonists (VKA), there are 
      recommendations regarding preoperative or postoperative administration. 
      Management of the new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) was supposed to be easier - but 
      some aspects must be considered. Due to the different pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      substances such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, different 
      recommendations are given.Upon periprocedural management, thromboembolic risk has 
      to be considered in patients treated with NOACs. NOACS have a pharmacokinetic 
      advantage in terms of a rapid onset and rapid elimination via the liver and 
      kidneys. Impaired renal function results in extended half-life of NOACs 
      considerably.Surgical procedures under NOACS can be scheduled at the beginning of 
      next dosing interval or omitted in low/minimal bleeding risk patients, so that 
      only 2-3 NOAC doses are not administered. In patients with moderate and high risk 
      of bleeding, there should be a NOAC break of 24-48 h prior to surgery in order to 
      allow a corresponding decay of the active metabolite. In patients with 
      low/intermediate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging is necessary if the 
      "unprotected" time (NOAC break) is less than 4-5-(7) days. In patients at high 
      risk of thromboembolism, individual consideration must be taken regarding 
      bridging or extended NOAC break. Whether NOACs can be dispensed or bridging is 
      necessary in these patients must be clarified in randomized trials for 
      periprocedural management of NOACs patients.

PG  - S5-S12

AB  - Although currently available anticoagulants are effective for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders, they have several drawbacks. Low molecular 
      weight heparin and fondaparinux produce a predictable level of anticoagulation 
      that obviates the need for coagulation monitoring, but they must be given 
      parenterally, which renders them inconvenient for long-term use. Vitamin K 
      antagonists, such as warfarin, are administered orally, but produce a variable 
      anticoagulant response because genetic polymorphisms, dietary vitamin K intake 
      and multiple drug-drug interactions affect their metabolism. Consequently, 
      coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustments are needed to ensure that a 
      therapeutic level of anticoagulation is achieved. This is burdensome for patients 
      and physicians, and costly for the healthcare system. These limitations have 
      prompted the development of new oral anticoagulants that target thrombin or 
      factor Xa. The new agents produce such a predictable anticoagulant response that 
      they can be given in fixed doses without monitoring. This paper focuses on the 
      new oral anticoagulants in the most advanced stages of development.

PG  - 633-41
LID - 10.1160/TH10-01-0066 [doi]
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety of four fixed-dose 
      regimens of edoxaban with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). In this 12-week, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational 
      study, 1,146 patients with AF and risk of stroke were randomised to edoxaban 30 
      mg qd, 30 mg bid, 60 mg qd, or 60 mg bid or warfarin dose-adjusted to a target 
      international normalised ratio of 2.0-3.0. The study was double-blind to edoxaban 
      dose, but open-label to warfarin. Primary outcomes were occurrence of major 
      and/or clinically relevant non-major bleeding and elevated hepatic enzymes and/or 
      bilirubin. Mean age was 65 +/- 8.7 years and 64.4% were warfarin-naïve. Whereas 
      major plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 3.2% of patients 
      randomised to warfarin, the incidence of bleeding was significantly higher with 
      the edoxaban 60 mg bid (10.6%; p=0.002) and 30 mg bid regimens (7.8%; p=0.029), 
      but not with the edoxaban 60 mg qd (3.8%) or 30 mg qd regimens (3.0%). For the 
      same total daily dose of 60 mg, both bleeding frequency and trough edoxaban 
      concentrations were higher in the 30-mg bid group than in the 60-mg qd group. 
      There were no significant differences in hepatic enzyme elevations or bilirubin 
      values among the groups. The safety profiles of edoxaban 30 and 60 mg qd in 
      patients with AF were similar to warfarin. In contrast, the edoxaban bid regimens 
      were associated with more bleeding than warfarin. These results suggest that in 
      this three-month study, edoxaban 30 or 60 mg qd are safe and well-tolerated.

TI  - The evolving role of dabigatran etexilate in clinical practice.
PG  - 2053-72
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE) affect millions of 
      patients. The vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, has been the main oral 
      anticoagulant used to treat these conditions despite many limitations associated 
      with its use. Recently, multiple novel oral anticoagulants have been approved and 
      are reshaping how patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk of stroke and 
      patients with VTE are treated. The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran 
      etexilate , is among these novel agents that have been developed to overcome 
      limitations with warfarin. AREAS COVERED: In this article, authors describe the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dabigatran etexilate and 
      summarize the clinical evidence and controversy surrounding its use in the US, 
      Canada and Europe. EXPERT OPINION: Dabigatran has demonstrated similar efficacy 
      and safety to enoxaparin for VTE prevention in patients undergoing hip and knee 
      arthroplasty, and to warfarin for the treatment of VTE. Dabigatran (110 mg) is 
      noninferior and dabigatran (150 mg) is superior to warfarin for stroke prevention 
      in patients with nonvalvular AF, with a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage 
      reported at both doses. Apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban provide alternate 
      anticoagulant options to dabigatran. While there are many similarities, there are 
      also significant differences to consider in agent selection based on 
      patient-specific characteristics.

TI  - NOAC or Warfarin for Atrial Fibrillation: Does Time in Therapeutic Range Matter?
PG  - 60-4
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest cardiac arrhythmia currently affecting 
      1-2% of the general population, with stroke being one of its most fearsome 
      complications. Dose-adjusted warfarin is an established treatment for reduction 
      of thromboembolic risk but mandates dietary restrictions and need for routine 
      blood monitoring. Novel oral anticoagulants (Dabigatran - patent: 
      US20110082299A1, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim; Rivaroxaban - patent: 
      US20150175590A1, manufactured by Bayer; Apixaban - patent: US20140335178A1, 
      manufactured jointly by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb; Edoxaban - patent: 
      WO2013026553A1, manufactured by Daiichi Sankyo) have recently been introduced 
      that might provide at least equal reduction in thromboembolic risk to patients; 
      negating the need for dietary restrictions and routine blood tests. The most 
      recent National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, UK guidelines from 
      August 2014 suggest consideration of one of the novel oral anticoagulants if the 
      time in therapeutic range is less than 65%. In this study, the evidence for four 
      novel oral anticoagulants is reviewed and the anticoagulation success with 
      warfarin with atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart valves assessed in a large 
      UK District General Hospital. Fifty-eight patients were identified with 
      mechanical heart valve and 2737 patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients with 
      atrial fibrillation had a significantly better TTR when compared with the 
      patients included in the NOAC trials. Our results were similar with the Auricula 
      registry. However, 25% of patients had TTR<65% and they would need to be 
      considered for NOACs. Our data suggest that the degree of benefit seen in the 
      NOAC trials might not be expected in our cohort of patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. Interestingly, our patients with atrial fibrillation had a much 
      better mean TTR of 76.4% and required less INR tests (12/year) compared to 
      patients with mechanical heart valve who had a mean TTR of 61.4% and required 
      more INR tests (26/year).

TI  - Exposure Matching-Based Pediatric Dose Selection for Drugs with Renal Excretion - 
      Lessons Learned from Pediatric Development of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 1174-1187
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3396 [doi]
AB  - The pediatric clinical development programs of the direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have recently been completed, with 
      apixaban close to the finish line. One common pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristic 
      of these four DOACs is that renal excretion contributes 27% or more in their 
      elimination, resulting in age-dependent drug clearance in both pediatric and 
      adult subjects. Several lessons have been learned from adult exposure matching 
      and pediatric dose selection for DOACs. The main goal of this tutorial is to 
      provide an informed perspective on pediatric dose selection for renally excreted 
      drugs, using these four DOACs as case examples. This tutorial is organized into 
      seven steps: (1) consideration of age-related differences in disease and response 
      to treatment; (2) consideration of age-related differences in drug absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion; (3) selection of the reference adult 
      population and exposure for pediatric exposure matching; (4) prediction of 
      pediatric clearance and pediatric dose selection based on data from young adults; 
      (5) conduct and design of efficient pediatric PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies 
      that inform dose selection; (6) assessment of exposure matching and dose 
      adjustment using population PK simulation; (7) evaluation of the need for dose 
      adjustment in pediatric sub-populations.

TI  - Evaluation of DOAC Filter, a new device to remove direct oral anticoagulants from 
      plasma samples.
PG  - 636-642
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13267 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Directs oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can interfere with coagulation 
      assays, especially in thrombophilia workup. To avoid these interferences, a new 
      device, DOAC Filter, allows the removal of DOACs from citrated plasma. This study 
      aims to confirm that DOAC Filter efficiently removes DOACs and to ascertain that 
      coagulation assays are not impacted by filtration. METHODS: Directs oral 
      anticoagulants Filter (Diagnostica Stago, France) is a filtration cartridge in 
      which DOAC molecules are trapped by noncovalent binding, while plasma is filtered 
      through a solid phase. Normal pool plasma (NPP) spiked with DOACs up to 
      300 ng/mL, with dabigatran etexilate (n = 27), rivaroxaban (n = 35), apixaban 
      (n = 33), and edoxaban (n = 27) or 120 ng/mL for betrixaban (n = 4), and 18 
      plasma's samples from DOAC-treated patients were used to assess efficacy. The 
      potential impact of DOAC Filter on coagulation assays was evaluated with NPP and 
      plasma's samples from positive and negative lupus anticoagulant (LA) patients. 
      RESULTS: Directs oral anticoagulants concentrations measured after filtration 
      were below the limit of detection (LoD) of DOAC-specific assays for all plasmas 
      tested, except for one apixaban plasma sample, with postfiltration concentration 
      slightly higher than anti-Xa assay LoD (25.1 ng/mL). Coagulation assays results 
      varied between -4 and +8% after filtration and between -6 and +8% for LA plasmas. 
      Such limited variations are not expected to have any clinical impact. CONCLUSION: 
      Directs oral anticoagulants Filter efficiently removes DOACs from plasma and 
      achieves concentrations below DOAC-specific assays LoD, except in the case of one 
      apixaban sample. The integrity of plasma is respected, and the cartridge seems 
      not to impact LA diagnosis.

      Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 745-7
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-15-1281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distribution of anti-factor Xa activity (AXA) values in 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients on edoxaban therapy has not been 
      fully elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The steady-state trough and peak AXA 
      values were measured in 66 NVAF patients. The trough AXA value did not differ 
      significantly between the 60-mg and the 30-mg OD groups (0.17±0.13 IU/ml vs. 
      0.12±0.11 IU/ml, respectively; P=0.17). Similarly, the peak AXA value did not 
      differ significantly between the 2 groups (1.45±0.81 IU/ml vs. 1.25±0.48 IU/ml, 
      respectively; P=0.26). CONCLUSIONS: Recommended dosing should be followed for 
      sufficient efficacy of edoxaban. (Circ J 2016; 80: 745-747).

TI  - Novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation: dawn of a new era.
PG  - 34-44
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2013.01.2622 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important cause of ischemic stroke and is the 
      underlying cause of > 20% of all strokes, with increasing age being a risk 
      factor. Until recently, warfarin was the only available oral anticoagulant used 
      to decrease this risk in patients with AF. However, there are several 
      disadvantages of warfarin use, such as the requirement for monitoring the 
      international normalized ratio, its wide range of drug-food interactions, and its 
      narrow therapeutic index. Thus, there has been a strong impetus for the 
      development of newer oral anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics that 
      obviate the need for monitoring the international normalized ratio. The US Food 
      and Drug Administration has approved a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and 
      2 factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for stroke prevention in 
      patients with nonvalvular AF. There are several other new oral anticoagulant 
      agents on the horizon, including the factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban. This review 
      article discusses the pharmacological properties, clinical trial data, and 
      practical issues associated with the use of these novel oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Comparing the Cost Effectiveness of Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants 
      with Well-Managed Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Patients 
      at High Risk of Bleeding.
PG  - 317-325
LID - 10.1007/s40256-018-0279-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared the cost effectiveness of non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin using results from clinical 
      trials evaluating NOACs. However, the time in therapeutic range (TTR) of warfarin 
      groups ranged across clinical trials, and all were below the therapeutic goal of 
      70%. We compared the cost effectiveness of edoxaban 60 mg, apixaban 5 mg, 
      dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, and well-managed 
      warfarin with a TTR of 70% in preventing stroke among patients with atrial 
      fibrillation at high risk of bleeding. METHODS: For the six treatments, we used a 
      Markov state-transition model to quantify lifetime costs in $US and effectiveness 
      in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We simulated relative risk ratios of 
      clinical events with each NOAC versus warfarin with a TTR of 70% using published 
      regression models that predict how the incidence of thrombotic or hemorrhagic 
      events changes for each unit change in TTR. We re-ran our analysis for two other 
      estimates of TTR: 65 and 75%. RESULTS: Treatment with edoxaban 60 mg cost 
      $US127,520/QALY gained compared with warfarin with a TTR of 70% and cost 
      $US41,860/QALY gained compared with warfarin with a TTR of 65%. However, warfarin 
      with a TTR of 75% was more effective and less expensive than all NOACs. For three 
      levels of TTR, apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, and 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg were dominated strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative cost 
      effectiveness of edoxaban and warfarin is highly sensitive to TTR. At the 
      $US100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, our results suggest that warfarin 
      is the most cost-effective treatment for patients who can achieve a TTR of 70%.

TI  - DOAC plasma levels measured by chromogenic anti-Xa assays and HPLC-UV in 
      apixaban- and rivaroxaban-treated patients from the START-Register.
PG  - 214-222

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To measure direct factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, 
      rivaroxaban) concentrations, dedicated chromogenic anti-Xa assays are recommended 
      as suitable methods to provide rapid drug quantification. Moreover, the 
      high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
      reported as a reliable quantitative technique. We investigated seven anti-Xa 
      assays and an HPLC-UV method for measurement of apixaban and rivaroxaban levels 
      in patients enrolled in the START-Register. METHODS: A total of 127 apixaban and 
      124 rivaroxaban samples were tested by HPLC-UV and the following anti-Xa assays: 
      Biophen DiXaI and Heparin LRT (Hyphen BioMed), Berichrom and Innovance Heparin 
      (Siemens), STA-Liquid Anti-Xa (Stago Diagnostics), Technochrom anti-Xa 
      (Technoclone), and HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa (Werfen). Each method was performed in 
      one of the participating laboratories: Bologna, Cremona, Florence, and Padua. 
      RESULTS: Our data confirmed the overestimation of apixaban and rivaroxaban levels 
      by the antithrombin-supplemented anti-Xa method (Berichrom). Performances and 
      reproducibility of the six anti-Xa assays not supplemented with antithrombin and 
      the HPLC-UV method were good, with limits of quantification from 8-39 ng/mL 
      (apixaban) and 15-33 ng/mL (rivaroxaban). The six chromogenic methods showed good 
      concordances with the quantitative HPLC-UV [bias: -26.9-22.3 ng/mL (apixaban), 
      -11.3-18.7 ng/mL (rivaroxaban)]. Higher bias and wider range between limits of 
      agreement were observed at higher concentrations [<100 ng/mL: bias 
      -21.3-4.1 ng/mL (apixaban) and -6.2-3.8 ng/mL (rivaroxaban); >200 ng/mL: bias 
      -42.2-36.8 ng/mL (apixaban) and -20.1-68.9 ng/mL (rivaroxaban)]. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, the anti-Xa assays not supplemented with antithrombin and the HPLC-UV 
      method proved to be suitable for apixaban and rivaroxaban quantification.

TI  - Comparison of the phase III clinical trial designs of novel oral anticoagulants 
      versus warfarin for the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: 
      implications for clinical practice.
PG  - 111-27
LID - 10.1007/s40256-013-0062-z [doi]
AB  - Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the backbone of 
      thromboprophylaxis in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, their limitations have 
      encouraged the development of a new generation of oral anticoagulants. This 
      review compares the different designs and procedures used to conduct four phase 
      III trials that tested dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban versus 
      VKAs. Although pharmacologic characteristics and results of the main trials are 
      briefly discussed, this review mainly focuses on study designs, enrollment 
      criteria, populations studied, quality metrics, and transition strategies between 
      oral anticoagulants. While each of the trials was of high quality, performed 
      independently, and led by independent academic groups, substantial differences 
      exist in terms of drug pharmacology and trial characteristics. Caution is advised 
      when comparing results across trials as practicing clinicians strive to 
      personalize anticoagulation treatments for their individual patients. We believe 
      that the differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the 
      available novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), coupled with substantial 
      heterogeneity in the trial populations and designs and procedures used to conduct 
      the trials, support an important role for each of the NOACs dependent upon the 
      specific clinical scenario faced by the practicing clinician.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      efflux on edoxaban absorption in gastrointestinal tracts quantitatively by a 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model constructed with clinical and 
      non-clinical observations (using GastroPlus™ software). An absorption process was 
      described by the advanced compartmental absorption and transit model with the 
      P-gp function. A human PBPK model was constructed by integrating the clinical and 
      non-clinical observations. The constructed model was demonstrated to reproduce 
      the data observed in the mass-balance study. Thus, elimination pathways can be 
      quantitatively incorporated into the model. A constructed model successfully 
      described the difference in slopes of plasma concentration (Cp)-time curve at 
      around 8 - 24 hr post-dose between intravenous infusion and oral administration. 
      Furthermore, the model without P-gp efflux activity can reproduce the Cp-time 
      profile in the absence of P-gp activity observed from the clinical DDI study 
      results. Since the difference of slopes between intravenous infusion and oral 
      administration also disappeared by the absence of P-gp efflux activity, P-gp must 
      be a key molecule to govern edoxaban's PK behavior. The constructed PBPK model 
      will help us to understand the significant contribution of P-gp in edoxaban's 
      disposition in gastrointestinal tracts quantitatively.

AB  - There are several excellent alternatives to warfarin on the horizon for atrial 
      fibrillation. Results from the trials, as well as pharmacokinetic data from the 
      edoxaban studies, suggest that dose selection, based on pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic properties, is a critical component in the development of novel 
      anticoagulants. Greater flexibility in dosing with edoxaban and the opportunity 
      for dose adjustment throughout the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial may be advantageous in 
      the competitive field of novel oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Urgent monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation: a tentative approach based on routine laboratory tests.
PG  - 269-74
LID - 10.1007/s11239-014-1082-5 [doi]
AB  - The number of patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who will be candidates 
      for antithrombotic therapy with direct oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) is exponentially arising worldwide, thus 
      posing substantial economic and organizational challenges for their urgent 
      monitoring. Due to long turnaround time and inherent technical complexity, liquid 
      chromatography techniques are unsuitable for rapid assessment of their 
      concentration. Even the use of surrogate tests such as thrombin clotting time or 
      anti-factor Xa activity carries some economic and technical drawbacks. Based on 
      literature data, we have hence developed an algorithm based on first-line tests 
      for urgent screening of the anticoagulant effect of direct oral anticoagulants, 
      which entails activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for dabigatran and 
      prothrombin time (PT) for rivaroxaban. Although these tests also display a 
      concentration-dependent prolongation in patients taking apixaban and edoxaban, 
      neither of them is sufficiently sensitive for providing accurate estimation of 
      the pharmacodynamic effect, so that the measurement of anti-factor Xa activity 
      remains the most suitable approach in patients taking these drugs. According to 
      literature data, this strategy appears suitable to reliably define the thrombotic 
      or bleeding risk in an urgent setting, contextually saving precious laboratory 
      resources.

      Oral Anticoagulants and Heparins.
PG  - 259-263
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1676317 [doi]
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) currently require no monitoring for 
      routine therapy of atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Measurement of 
      activity, however, may be important in patients with major and life-threatening 
      bleeding, patients needing emergent surgery, in reversal situations, or in 
      patients at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis due to underlying conditions. For 
      these patients, a widely available and rapid turnaround assay would be optimal. 
      To date, there is no such assay available, especially for the direct factor Xa 
      inhibitors. This report describes the performance of a new, rapid turnaround, 
      point-of-care (PoC) assay for measuring the activity of a range of 
      anticoagulants, including DOACs and heparins, in emergency situations and for 
      routine measurement in high-risk patients. Perosphere Technologies' PoC 
      coagulometer is a handheld instrument that performs individual coagulation tests 
      on samples of fresh whole blood (∼10 µL) with clotting activated by glass contact 
      and endpoint determination performed by infrared spectroscopy. In preclinical 
      studies using rats anticoagulated with therapeutic doses of edoxaban or 
      enoxaparin, the PoC coagulometer showed a strong linear correlation between 
      pharmacokinetic parameters and clotting time with edoxaban (r (2) = 0.994) and 
      with enoxaparin (r (2) = 0.967). These preclinical results suggest that this PoC 
      coagulometer would be ideal to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 
      anticoagulants and their reversal agents. The PoC bedside instrument delivers 
      results within minutes and requires no more than a drop of whole blood. Studies 
      are underway to confirm these results in humans and to further characterize the 
      performance of the instrument.

TI  - Advances in oral anticoagulation treatment: the safety and efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism.
PG  - 309-323
AB  - Arterial and venous thromboembolic diseases are a clinical and economic burden 
      worldwide. In addition to traditional agents such as vitamin K antagonists and 
      heparins, newer oral agents - such as the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran - have been 
      shown to be effective across several indications. Rivaroxaban has been shown to 
      have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including a 
      rapid onset of action. In addition, there is no requirement for routine 
      coagulation monitoring; and no dose adjustment is necessary for age alone, sex, 
      or body weight. Rivaroxaban has successfully met primary efficacy and safety 
      endpoints in large, randomized phase III trials across several indications, 
      including: prevention of venous thromboembolism in orthopedic patients undergoing 
      elective hip or knee replacement surgery; treatment of deep vein thrombosis and 
      secondary prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation; and secondary prevention of 
      acute coronary syndrome. Rivaroxaban and the other newer oral anticoagulants are 
      likely to improve outcomes in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      events, and will offer patients and physicians alternative treatment options.

TI  - Potential Effect of Substituting Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate for 
      Estimated Creatinine Clearance for Dosing of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 1996-2002
LID - 10.1111/jgs.14288 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential effect of substituting glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) estimates for renal clearance estimated using the 
      Cockcroft-Gault method (CrCL-CG) to calculate direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      dosing. DESIGN: Simulation and retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Community, 
      academic institution, nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: Noninstitutionalized 
      individuals aged 19 to 80 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey (NHANES) (2011/12) (n = 4,687) and medically stable research participants 
      aged 25 to 105 (n = 208). MEASUREMENTS: Age, height, weight, sex, race, serum 
      creatinine, CrCL-CG, and GFR (according to the Modification of Diet in Renal 
      Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations). Outcome 
      measures were dosing errors if GFR were to be substituted for CrCL-CG. RESULTS: 
      Renal clearance estimates according to all methods were highly correlated (P < 
      .001), although at lower clearances, substitution of GFR estimates for CrCL-CG 
      resulted in failure to recognize needs for dose reductions of rivaroxaban or 
      edoxaban in 28% of NHANES subjects and 47% to 56% of research subjects. At a 
      CrCL-CG of less than 30 mL/min, GFR estimates missed indicated dosage reductions 
      for dabigatran in 18% to 21% of NHANES subjects and 57% to 86% of research 
      subjects. Age and weight contributed to differences between renal clearance 
      estimates (P < .001), but correction of GFR for body surface area (BSA) did not 
      reduce dosing errors. At a CrCL-CG greater than 95 mL/min, edoxaban is not 
      recommended, and GFR esimates misclassified 24% of NHANES and 39% of research 
      subjects. Correction for BSA reduced misclassification to 7% for NHANES and 14% 
      in research subjects. CONCLUSION: Substitution of GFR estimates for estimated 
      CrCl can lead to failure to recognize indications for reducing DOAC dose and 
      potentially higher bleeding rates than in randomized trials.

      pharmacological profiles.
PG  - 1542-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Factor Xa (FXa), a key serine protease that converts prothrombin to 
      thrombin in the coagulation cascade, is a promising target enzyme for the 
      prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. DU-176b is a novel 
      antithrombotic agent that directly inhibits FXa activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      the in vitro pharmacological profiles and in vivo effects of DU-176b in animal 
      models of thrombosis and bleeding. METHODS: In vitro, FXa inhibition, specificity 
      and anticoagulant activities were examined. Oral absorption was studied in rats 
      and cynomolgus monkeys. In vivo effects were studied in rat and rabbit models of 
      venous thrombosis and tail bleeding. RESULTS: DU-176b inhibited FXa with Ki 
      values of 0.561 nm for free FXa, 2.98 nm for prothrombinase, and exhibited >10 
      000-fold selectivity for FXa. In human plasma, DU-176b doubled prothrombin time 
      and activated partial thromboplastin time at concentrations of 0.256 and 0.508 
      microm, respectively. DU-176b did not impair platelet aggregation by ADP, 
      collagen or U46619. DU-176b was highly absorbed in rats and monkeys, as 
      demonstrated by more potent anti-Xa activity and higher drug concentration in 
      plasma following oral administration than a prototype FXa inhibitor, DX-9065a. In 
      vivo, DU-176b dose-dependently inhibited thrombus formation in rat and rabbit 
      thrombosis models, although bleeding time in rats was not significantly prolonged 
      at an antithrombotic dose. CONCLUSIONS: DU-176b is a more potent and selective 
      FXa inhibitor with high oral bioavailability compared with its prototype, 
      DX-9065a. DU-176b represents a promising new anticoagulant for the prophylaxis 
      and treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

PG  - 119-25
AB  - The first factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban had been released on market, and 
      apixaban and edoxaban are preparing for clinical use in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. These newer antithrombotic agents are attractive for prevention of 
      thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation because of their favorable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles that seems to be better than that of 
      direct thrombin inhibitor. The reports of rivaroxaban and apixaban have been 
      showed noninferiority or superiority in their efficacy endpoints and also in 
      safety endpoints even on fixed dose regimen without anticoagulation monitoring. 
      There may be still present an important issue that we have to pay attention to 
      find appropriate doses for the patients with renal impairment, aged or low body 
      weight.

TI  - Twice- or once-daily dosing of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention: a 
      fixed-effects meta-analysis with predefined heterogeneity quality criteria.
PG  - e99276
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0099276 [doi]
LID - e99276
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors or 
      factor Xa inhibitors) are in clinical use for various indications. The dosing 
      regimens differ between twice-daily and once-daily dosing for the prevention of 
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the availability of the results 
      from four phase 3 studies (>70,000 patients), we explored whether twice-daily or 
      once-daily dosing provides better risk-benefit balance among novel oral 
      anticoagulants. METHODS: We conducted a strict, stepwise, fixed-effects 
      meta-analysis with predefined heterogeneity quality criteria to generate the most 
      appropriate common estimates for twice-daily (BID) or once-daily (QD) dosing 
      regimens. An indirect comparison of these dosing regimens with fixed-effects 
      meta-analysis common estimates (where available), or individual compound results, 
      was done respectively. RESULTS: Comparing indirectly BID vs QD dosing regimens 
      resulted in hazard ratios (HR [95% confidence interval]) for stroke and systemic 
      embolism of 0.75 (0.58-0.96) for dabigatran 150 mg BID, and 0.91 (0.73-1.13) for 
      apixaban BID vs the QD dosing regimen. For ischemic stroke, the HR of BID vs QD 
      was 0.85 (0.69-1.05). For intracranial hemorrhage, BID vs rivaroxaban QD was 0.57 
      (0.37-0.88) and, vs edoxaban QD, 0.81 (0.54-1.22). Due to heterogeneity, common 
      estimates for major bleeding QD or BID were not justified, therefore indirect 
      comparison of regimens were not possible. All non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants reduced all-cause mortality vs warfarin with a HR of 0.90 
      (0.86-0.96) without differences between regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 
      available phase 3 study evidence, the twice-daily dosing regimen of non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants appears to offer a more balanced risk-benefit 
      profile with respect to stroke prevention and intracranial hemorrhage.

TI  - Factor Xa inhibitors--new anticoagulants for secondary haemostasis.
PG  - 260-7
AB  - Oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors are a promising alternative to current 
      anticoagulants. This paper reviews the latest developments of oral direct FXa 
      inhibitors and focuses on those which have been approved for the prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip or knee replacement or are in 
      advanced development and have passed phase II (proof of principle) testing. The 
      most advanced drugs are apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, eribaxaban, rivaroxaban, 
      LY517717, TAK-442, and YM150. Rivaroxaban (Xareltoâ) is the first direct FXa 
      inhibitor which has recently been approved for the prevention of VTE in adult 
      patients after elective hip or knee replacement in several countries, including 
      the European Union and Canada. Rivaroxaban has a flat dose-dependent 
      anticoagulant response with a wide therapeutic window and low potential for 
      drug-drug and drug-food interactions. Rivaroxaban can be given in fixed doses 
      without coagulation monitoring. This review describes the pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic profiles and the results of clinical trials with FXa inhibitors 
      in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.

TI  - Discrepancies in Recommendations on Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions for 
      Anticancer Medications and Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC): A Comparative 
      Analysis of Different Clinical Decision Support Systems and Sources.
LID - 10.3390/ph18071044 [doi]
LID - 1044
AB  - Background/objectives: In some cases of concomitant use of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOAC) and certain anticancer medications, pharmacokinetic 
      interactions are expected; however, clinical data is scarce. This report reviews 
      the recommendations on the use of DOAC concurrently with anticancer drugs 
      according to different clinical decision support systems and sources, with a 
      focus on discrepancies. Methods: We reviewed the recommendations from the 
      American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), 
      summary of product characteristics (SPC) in FASS (Swedish medicine information 
      portal), the Swedish clinical decision support system Janusmed, and information 
      from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the concomitant use of apixaban, 
      edoxaban, and rivaroxaban (activated factor X (FXa) inhibitors) and 80 anticancer 
      drugs from 11 categories (240 drug pairs). Results: No warnings of expected 
      pharmacokinetic drug interactions between FXa inhibitors and anticancer drugs 
      were found for 155 drug pairs (65%) across all sources. The remaining 35% of drug 
      pairs were flagged as having possible interactions with FXa inhibitors according 
      to at least one source. Discrepancies in the recommendations from the different 
      sources were reported. The reported discrepancies were, for the most part, 
      associated with different assessments of the mechanism and the extent of 
      pharmacokinetic interactions of each anticancer medication. Also, knowledge 
      sources have different approaches to reporting potential interactions, in some 
      cases reporting clinically relevant strictly pharmacokinetic interactions, 
      whereas others include even patient-specific factors. Conclusions: The lack of 
      clinical data and different recommendations can make clinical decisions on the 
      concomitant use of DOAC and anticancer drugs difficult. Our compilation is meant 
      to assist clinicians in making decisions based on the available evidence, even if 
      it is scarce.

AB  - For several decades vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were the standard for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation. Because of inconvenience associated with their 
      use (frequently VKA levels cannot be consistently maintained within the 
      therapeutic range, e.g. due to food and drug interactions, which necessitates 
      regular control of international normalized ratios) alternative compounds have 
      recently been developed, the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran (a 
      direct antithrombin) as well as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban (direct factor 
      Xa inhibitors). All these agents show a predictable pharmacokinetic profile 
      making routine laboratory controls unnecessary. Moreover, DOACs do not only show 
      a similar or even better efficacy, but also a more attractive safety profile in 
      terms of similar or less major bleeding complications, where all DOACs 
      significantly reduce the rate of intracranial bleeding when compared to VKAs. 
      This review summarizes the pharmacological characteristics and clinical study 
      results of DOACs that have been tested in phase 3 trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bleeding risk may increase when Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors are 
      co-administered with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) due to pharmacokinetic 
      interactions, but real-world evidence on these interactions is inconsistent and 
      limited, particularly for edoxaban. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to 
      evaluate the overall and temporal risk of major bleeding associated with 
      concomitant use of AADs (amiodarone, dronedarone, diltiazem, verapamil) and FXa 
      inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) using the self-controlled case 
      series (SCCS) method. METHODS: A SCCS study was conducted using the Korean 
      National Health Insurance Service database. Patients who initiated FXa inhibitors 
      between July 2018 and December 2020, had AAD co-administration, and experienced 
      major bleeding were included. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for major bleeding 
      were estimated using conditional Poisson regression, adjusting for time-varying 
      covariates. RESULTS: A total of 963 patients were analyzed. Concomitant use of 
      amiodarone (IRR 2.16; 95% CI 1.73-2.70), diltiazem (IRR 1.96; 95% CI 1.63-2.35), 
      and verapamil (IRR 1.72; 95% CI 1.15-2.59) was associated with an increased risk 
      for major bleeding risk, while dronedarone did not (IRR 1.20; 95% CI 0.69-2.06). 
      The findings were consistent across different FXa inhibitors. Bleeding risk was 
      highest during the first month of co-administration and decreased over time, 
      remaining significant beyond three months for amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Concomitant use of FXa inhibitors with amiodarone, diltiazem, or verapamil was 
      related to an increased incidence of major bleeding, particularly during the 
      first month of co-administration. Close monitoring during this period may be 
      warranted for patients at high risk of bleeding.

AB  - Optically active 3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid (CHCA) derivatives are important 
      pharmaceutical intermediates. Due to the special rotatable structure, 
      enantioselective preparation of chiral CHCA is hard to achieve. To identify 
      efficient and enantioselective hydrolases for the biosynthesis of CHCA from 
      methyl 3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate (CHCM), target-oriented screening from soil 
      samples and gene mining from genome database were explored. All putative 
      hydrolases attempted displayed low enantioselectivity. A hydrolase-producing 
      strain JNU9335 was successfully identified with relatively high 
      enantioselectivity, and was designated as a strain of Acinetobacter sp. according 
      to 16S rDNA sequence and phylogenetic analysis. After optimization, strain 
      JNU9335 could produce 233 U·L(‒1) hydrolase with E value of 21. Isooctane/aqueous 
      biphasic system is favorable for the enzymatic resolution of CHCM, the E value of 
      JNU9335 could further be increased to 36. The newly identified JNU9335 could 
      tolerate as high as 1.0 M CHCM, producing (S)-CHCM with ee(s) of 99.6% and 
      isolation yield of 34.7%. This study provides an efficient biocatalyst for the 
      preparation of chiral 3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid derivatives.

LID - 10.1111/jth.13344 [doi]
AB  - Patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) may need interruption of treatment 
      before surgery or invasive procedures. Owing to their favorable pharmacokinetics, 
      DOAC could be interrupted for a fixed number of days before surgery or invasive 
      procedures without laboratory testing. However, there are a number of issues that 
      raise concerns about the safety of this strategy. In contrast, laboratory testing 
      prior to surgery or invasive procedures would provide a direct assessment of the 
      residual drug concentration and minimize the risk of bleeding. This forum is 
      aimed at discussing the pros and cons of the two strategies and fostering 
      discussion on this important issue. Overall, the laboratory strategy appears 
      superior in terms of patient safety and should be considered in patients 
      undergoing surgical or invasive procedures.

PG  - 20-23
LID - 10.1016/j.jpra.2017.08.008 [doi]
AB  - The development of novel oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) such as dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban has given patients better treatment 
      alternatives to aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin and warfarin, mainly for stroke 
      prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), 
      prophylaxis/treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and also for the secondary 
      prophylaxis of acute coronary syndromes. These agents are gaining in popularity 
      due to their more stable pharmacokinetic profile, fewer drug interactions, as 
      well as eliminating the need for routine monitoring. NOAC induced haematomas of 
      the upper limb are rare and there is no real consensus on management. We present 
      a case of a 70-year-old male on rivaroxaban who developed a delayed onset 
      intramuscular forearm haematoma after a simple fall onto his left arm. Simple 
      elevation of the limb was successful in leading to resolution of symptoms. As 
      these agents increase in popularity, clinicians need to be more aware of 
      potential risks of treatment and subsequent management.

TI  - The European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the Use of New Oral 
      Anticoagulants in Patients with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation - A Brief 
      Summary.
PG  - 115-9
LID - 10.15420/aer.2013.2.2.115 [doi]
AB  - New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative to vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) in the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) has produced a 
      practical guide to detail the use of NOACs in clinical practice. The guide 
      includes a practical start-up and follow-up scheme, emphasising the importance of 
      strict adherence to the regimen - the anticoagulant effect drops rapidly after 
      12-24 hours. There is also guidance on how to measure the anticoagulant effect of 
      NOACs, switching between anticoagulant regimes and dealing with dosing errors. 
      Physicians will have to consider the pharmacokinetic effect of drugs and 
      co-morbidities when prescribing NOACs - plasma levels of NOACs may be affected by 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates, as well as cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inducers or 
      inhibitors. In patients with chronic kidney disease, reduced doses of NOACs may 
      be indicated. Guidance is also given on the management of bleeding complications, 
      and the cessation and reinitiation of NOACs in patients undergoing surgical 
      interventions. Finally, the use of NOACs in specific clinical situations is 
      considered; these include patients with AF and coronary artery disease (CAD), 
      patients presenting with acute stroke while taking NOACs and patients with 
      cancer.

TI  - Risk Assessment for Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class IV Molecule 
      Containing Immediate Release Products: Use of In-Silico Prediction Tools and 
      Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling.
PG  - 97

AB  - Nitrosamines drug substance related impurities (NDSRI) are organic impurities, 
      highly potent mutagenic substances that are classified as human carcinogens. 
      Regulatory guidance's in this area provide procedures for control and risk 
      mitigation of NDSRI's in drug products. While efforts are made to control the 
      NDSRI's, cases where NDSRI's are observed post- pivotal bioequivalence studies 
      may require additional bioequivalence studies, between pre- and post- change 
      formulations. The recent USFDA (United State Food and Drug Administration) 
      guidance on "Control of Nitrosamine Impurities in Human Drugs" provides 
      alternative BE methodologies for biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) I, 
      II and III drugs based on in vitro testing. For BCS IV molecule 
      containing immediate release (IR) formulations, physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach is recommended. In this context, this 
      present article discusses use of PBPK modeling approaches as alternative BE 
      methodologies for BCS IV molecule containing IR products. We have summarized use 
      of in-house in silico tool for early risk prediction of NDSRI's solely based on 
      molecule structure. This tool was used to predict the carcinogenic potential of 
      37 BCS IV molecules and further clinical exposure risk assessment was conducted 
      on identified 5 high risk category molecules namely edoxaban, selumetinib, 
      bosutinib, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide where transporters are involved in 
      absorption. The PBPK models were used to evaluate the impact of altered 
      permeability and transporter kinetics on exposures, that may happen in presence 
      of antioxidants. Further, the impact of permeability within ± 10-20% was 
      evaluated on clinical exposures to determine permeability safe space (region 
      within which bioequivalence is guaranteed as compared to the target formulation).
